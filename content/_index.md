## How Did a Self-Aware Mind Evolve? 
Meditations on mind, myth, and evolution. *Cast off the scales from your eyes!*

### Key Points at a Glance 

*   Symbolic thought emerged ~50,000 years ago, yet the universal human symbol, "I am," or the ego appears globally entrenched only in the Holocene ~10 kya.
*   According to Eve Theory, women invented serpent-venom initiation rituals that reliably taught subject-object separation, producing powerful gene-culture evolution towards understanding "I am'" at a young age. 
*   The memory of this awakening is preserved in worldwide creation myths (often featuring serpents) and was transmitted global via bullroarer mystery cults.
