## How Did a Self-Aware Mind Evolve? 
Meditations on mind, myth, and evolution. *Cast the scales from your eyes!*

### TL;DR

*   Symbolic thought emerged ~50,000 years ago, yet the universal human symbol, "I," or the ego appears globally entrenched only in the Holocene ~10 kya.
*   According to [Eve Theory](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/eve-theory-of-consciousness-v3), women invented serpent-venom initiation rituals that reliably taught [subject-object separation](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/the-origins-of-human-consciousness), producing powerful gene-culture evolution towards understanding "I am'" at a young age.
*   The memory of this awakening is preserved worldwide in creation myths (cf. Lucifer, Nüwa, Quetzalcoatl) and was transmitted globally via [bullroarer mystery cults](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/the-bullroarer-much-more-than-you) (cf. Eluesinian Mysteries, Australian Dreamtime Rites).

### [About](/about/) 
I'm Andrew Cutler, a Machine Learning engineer researching human origins. 
My work connects psychology, comparative mythology, and AI to trace how [recursive self-awareness](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/deja-you-the-recursive-construction) evolved.
Snakecult.net is a place for me to put lightly-edited AI-generated essays that explore niche questions. (These are usually produced with OpenAI's Deep Research, which is less prone to hallucination.)
