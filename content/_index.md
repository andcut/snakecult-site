## How Did a Self-Aware Mind Evolve? 
Snake Cult deep cuts on mind, myth, and evolution.

### Key Points at a Glance 

*   Symbolic thought emerged ~50,000 years ago, yet the universal human symbol, "I am," or the ego appears globally entrenched only in the Holocene (~10,000 years ago).
*   According to Eve Theory, women invented serpent-venom initiation rituals that reliably taught subject-object separation, producing powerful gene-culture evolution towards understanding "I am'" at a young age. 
*   This pivotal awakening is preserved in worldwide creation myths (often featuring serpents and first couples) and was transmitted prehistorically through global networks of bullroarer-based mystery cults.
