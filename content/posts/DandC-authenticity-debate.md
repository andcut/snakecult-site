**TL;DR** <!-- ≤ 100 words, 3–7 bullets -->

- Section 132 was dictated by Joseph Smith on July 12 1843, revealing eternal marriage and plural wives in direct conflict with earlier monogamous teachings.
- Emma Smith destroyed the original; Joseph C. Kingsbury's copy is the earliest surviving manuscript preserved by Nauvoo insiders.
- Contemporary journals, Nauvoo Expositor affidavits, and later affidavits from associates corroborate its 1843 origin.
- RLDS/Community of Christ denies Joseph ever taught polygamy and alleges Brigham Young fabricated or altered the text.
- Scholarly analysis finds no substantive textual changes from the 1843 copies to the 1852 Deseret News publication, supporting Joseph's authorship despite ongoing theological debate.

## Introduction

**Doctrine and Covenants Section 132** is the Latter-day Saint scripture outlining **the “new and everlasting covenant” of eternal marriage, including plural marriage (polygamy)**. Recorded in **July 1843**, it was *privately* circulated among early Mormon leaders but *publicly* published only years after Joseph Smith’s death. This section has long been controversial. It **conflicted with earlier LDS teachings** (e.g., the 1835 “Article on Marriage” forbidding polygamy) and **with Joseph Smith’s public denials** of polygamy during his lifetime. As a result, **the authenticity and provenance of D&C 132 have been debated** since the mid-19th century.

## What Is D&C 132?

D&C 132 is a **revelation attributed to Joseph Smith** on **eternal marriage and plural wives**, with **July 12 1843** given as the date of dictation in Nauvoo, Illinois. The text, presented as the words of the Lord to Joseph, **answers Joseph’s inquiry about Old Testament patriarchs having multiple wives**. It proclaims that **certain covenants, including marriage, must be made and sealed by God’s authority to last into eternity**. It further asserts that **those who enter this “new and everlasting covenant” and are faithful may achieve exaltation**. Crucially, *embedded within the revelation is divine sanction of plural marriage:* it defends the actions of Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon in taking multiple wives, and warns Joseph’s wife **Emma Smith** to accept the principle of plural marriage or face destruction. In effect, D&C 132 provided the theological rationale for **polygamy** in early LDS practice, even as the church publicly remained monogamous at that time.

## Theological Tension

This revelation’s content starkly **contrasted with earlier LDS scripture and public teachings**. The **Book of Mormon** (1830) condemns taking multiple wives as “abominable” except if God explicitly commands it (Jacob 2:24–30). In 1835, the church added an *“Article on Marriage”* to its Doctrine and Covenants declaring that a man should have **one wife only**, pointedly denouncing polygamy. Joseph Smith himself, up through 1844, **repeatedly denied in public that he practiced or taught polygamy**, even calling such accusations “false and corrupt.” This makes Section 132 (kept secret at first) a **paradox**: privately, Joseph Smith was teaching select followers a doctrine wholly **at odds with the Church’s public stance** of the day.

## Recording and Preservation of the Revelation

According to contemporary LDS sources, **Joseph Smith dictated D&C 132 to his scribe William Clayton on July 12 1843**. Clayton recalled the three-hour session, writing *"sentence by sentence"* and later reading it back to Joseph for accuracy. Immediately after, Joseph's brother **Hyrum Smith** showed it to Emma, who "did not believe a word of it and appeared very rebellious." Emma allegedly seized and burned the original manuscript, though she later denied this. Unbeknownst to her, **Joseph C. Kingsbury made a secret copy** at Bishop Newel Whitney's request. This Kingsbury manuscript—carefully compared line-by-line to the original—is the **earliest surviving text** of Section 132. After Joseph's death (June 1844), the revelation circulated only among Brigham Young's inner circle. It was not published until **September 1852**, when Young publicly announced plural marriage in Utah and printed the text in the *Deseret News*. Section 132 was added to the Doctrine and Covenants in the **1876 edition** and formally canonized by vote in **1880**, replacing the earlier 1835 "Article on Marriage."

## Evidence Supporting Authenticity of Section 132

1. **Contemporary Jotting** – Willard Richards’s 1843 journal briefly notes “a revelation … on the subject of celestial marriage.”  
2. **Clayton’s Journal & Expositor** – William Clayton’s detailed entry and the *Nauvoo Expositor* affidavits echo Section 132’s unique doctrines.  
3. **Textual Consistency** – Comparisons of the 1843 Kingsbury copy with 1844 copies (Richards, Horace Whitney) and the 1852 printed text show only minor edits—no substantive doctrinal changes.  
4. **Later Affidavits** – In the 1860s–1890s, scribes and plural wives affirmed Joseph Smith’s role in authoring and living Section 132, corroborating its origin in Nauvoo rather than Utah.

## Theories Challenging Its Authenticity

1. **RLDS (Community of Christ)** denies Joseph ever taught or practiced polygamy and claims Brigham Young forged or altered Section 132 after 1844 to legitimize plural marriage. 
2. **Brighamite Conspiracy** – Critics argue the delayed public release (1852) under Brigham Young's leadership enabled a posthumous fabrication or tampering, pointing to handwriting oddities and Emma's vilification clause. 
3. **False Revelation by Joseph** – Some suggest Joseph retroactively invented Section 132 to justify his pre-1843 plural marriages, implying the revelation was self-serving rather than divine. 
4. **Variant‐Copy Rumors** – Fringe theories posit multiple versions circulated (some monogamous, some polygamous), with the polygamy portions later interpolated—though no alternate manuscripts have surfaced.

## FAQ

**Q 1. Why wasn’t Section 132 published in Joseph Smith’s lifetime?**  
**A.** Because its endorsement of plural marriage conflicted with public teachings and would have caused scandal, Joseph kept it secret among trusted leaders.  

**Q 2. What happened to the original manuscript?**  
**A.** Emma Smith allegedly destroyed it in anger; a secret copy by Joseph C. Kingsbury survives as the earliest text.  

**Q 3. How do scholars verify its 1843 origin?**  
**A.** Multiple independent journals (Clayton, Richards) and affidavits, along with consistent manuscript comparisons, confirm its dictation and preservation in Nauvoo.  

**Q 4. Why do RLDS/Community of Christ reject Section 132?**  
**A.** Emma and Joseph III repudiated polygamy, arguing no genuine Joseph Smith revelation sanctioned it, attributing the text to Brigham Young’s agenda.  

**Q 5. Does modern LDS Church still recognize Section 132?**  
**A.** Yes—while polygamy has ceased since 1890, Section 132 underpins the doctrine of eternal (celestial) marriage sealings between one man and one woman.
