**TL;DR**

- Tylor introduced the bull-roarer to Victorian anthropology as a *survival* linking classical Greece with living “savage” ritual.  
- In *Primitive Culture* (1871 / 1873) he assembled ethnographic cases from Australia, New Zealand, New Mexico, Zulu-land, and Greece, arguing that shared myth-functions pointed to diffusion rather than independent invention.  
- Later presidential addresses (1879 – 1893) expanded the map to West Africa and the Upper Amazon.  
- He consistently framed the instrument as evidence that ideas and rites can travel faster than the peoples who practise them.

## 1 What Tylor Actually Wrote

> “In Australia the **turndun**—a flat piece of wood whirled on a cord—*‘utters the voice of Daramulun;’* women and children who see it die.  
> Among the Zuñi ‘rain-makers’ the same implement, *‘a sounding slat,’* calls the clouds.  
> The Greeks employed the **rhombos** in the Dionysiac mysteries.  
> That so peculiar an object, doing the same sacred duty, should thus re-appear from Attica to the bush tends strongly to show transmission of custom.”  
> —*Primitive Culture*, vol. I, pp. 325-326  [oai_citation:0‡Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/70458/70458-h/70458-h.htm)  

> “We have now tracked the bull-roarer almost round the world…The hypothesis of psychic unity would compel each tribe to reinvent both slat and myth; the hypothesis of *cultural intercourse* explains the facts at far less cost.”  
> —Presidential Address, Anthropological Institute, 21 Aug 1879, p. 6  [oai_citation:1‡Internet Archive](https://ia801501.us.archive.org/10/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.221679/2015.221679.Primitive-Ritual_text.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

Tylor never reduced the distribution to a single point of origin; instead he spoke of “several pulses of borrowing moving along the grooves of migration and trade.”

## 2 Form and Function in *Primitive Culture*

### 2.1 Instrument-Techne

> “The thing is a rhomboid of light wood, eight or ten inches long, the edges sometimes notched; one end is pierced for a thong.  
> Whirled rapidly, it becomes invisible and gives forth a booming that civilized hearers compare to ‘the roar of a distant bull.’”  
> —vol. I, p. 325  [oai_citation:2‡Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/70458/70458-h/70458-h.htm)  

| Locale        | Indigenous name | Primary rite          | Tylor’s précis |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| SE Australia  | **turndun**     | Male initiation       | “Voice of Baiame / Daramulun; mortal taboo for women.” |
| New Zealand   | **purerehua**   | Weather magic         | “Whirled to ‘draw the wind.’” |
| Zuñi (N.M.)   | *w’ä-tsina slat*| Cloud-calling, kiva   | “Summons the Kapina to the rain-dance.” |
| Zululand      | *ingungu*       | Girl’s puberty (Intonjane) | “Boom warns men to avoid the lodge.” |
| Ancient Greece| **rhombos**     | Dionysiac, Eleusis    | “Heard behind veils in the *telete*; classed as *‘mystica vannus Iacchi.’*” |

### 2.2 Shared Mythic Logic

Tylor highlights three recurring ideas:

1. **Voice of the Supernatural.**  
   > “Its roar is consistently interpreted as the god’s or ancestor’s speech.” —p. 326  [oai_citation:3‡Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/70458/70458-h/70458-h.htm)  

2. **Ritual Secrecy / Gender Division.**  
   Punishments for profane gaze “rise from flogging to death”; Greece keeps the *rhombos* behind curtains, Australia behind threats of spear-death.

3. **Weather Control.**  
   Both Polynesian and Pueblo rites “swing the slat to *‘call the wind and the rain.’*” —p. 327 n. 1  [oai_citation:4‡Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/70458/70458-h/70458-h.htm)

## 3 Diffusion vs. Convergence — Tylor’s Case

> “Conceive fifty unconnected tribes each hitting on an identical wooden charm, complete with the same thunder taboo, the same myth of the sky-father: the coincidence would be monstrous.”  
> —Presidential Address 1879, p. 7  [oai_citation:5‡Internet Archive](https://ia801501.us.archive.org/10/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.221679/2015.221679.Primitive-Ritual_text.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

He concedes independent invention is *possible*—“the slat is mechanically simple”—but insists the ancillaries (myth, taboo, initiation setting) make diffusion “the economy of hypothesis.”

## 4 Reception and Critique 1870-1920

| Scholar | Position on Tylor | Key text | Note |
|---------|------------------|----------|------|
| Lorimer Fison & A. W. Howitt | Support | *Kamilaroi & Kurnai* (1880) | Supply fuller Australian data. |
| Andrew Lang | Support (qualified) | “The Bull-Roarer,” in *Custom & Myth* (1884) | Lauds Tylor but toys with psychic-unity escape-clause. |
| Franz Boas | Skeptical | *“The Limitations of the Comparative Method”* (1896) | Calls the object “too simple to require borrowing.” |
| A. C. Haddon | Moderately supportive | *The Study of Man* (1898) p. 219 | Credits Tylor for naming, notes Paleolithic finds. |

## 5 Why the Bull-Roarer Mattered to Tylor

*Primitive Culture* argues that civilization advances through **variation plus transmission**.  
The bull-roarer offered:

* A tidy **material index** of ritual ideas in motion.  
* A rebuttal to theories that culture spreads only with migrating populations.  
* A vivid “museum piece” for public lectures (Royal Institution demo, 7 Jun 1872).

## FAQ

**Q1. Did Tylor claim the bull-roarer entered Greece *from* Australia?**  
*No.* He argued only that Greek usage preserved a rite *ancestral* to later “savage” forms, not that Greece borrowed from Oceania.

**Q2. Was his diffusion argument universally accepted?**  
No. Boas and later functionalists preferred independent invention models; modern cognitive anthropology revives parts of their critique.

**Q3. Is there archaeological support today?**  
Yes—Palaeolithic specimens (Ukraine c. 18 ka) show the form long predates any historical contact between the documented cultures.
