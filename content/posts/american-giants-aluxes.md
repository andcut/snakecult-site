**TL;DR**

- Many Native American stories insist *somebody* lived here first—giants, dwarfs, ant-people, spirit-folk.  
- A few match archaeology (e.g. Inuit oral memory of the Dorset Tuniit).  
- Motifs: earlier builders, cataclysms, territorial bequeathal, moral warnings.  
- Earliest textual records span Danish, Spanish, Nahuatl, K’iche’, Quechua, French, Algonquian, and English.

## 1 · Arctic & Sub-Arctic

### Inuit — **Tuniit / Tornit**

- **Profile.** Enormous, shy seal-hunters "easily put to flight." 
- **Mythic role.** Built tent-rings, hauled walrus on their backs, fled when Thule Inuit arrived. 
- **Record.** Knud Rasmussen, *Fifth Thule Expedition* field notes, 1921–24.[^1]

### Labrador Inuit — **Inurajait / Ijirait**

- Vanish when seen; plausibly folk memory of Paleoeskimo bands.[^2]

## 2 · Southwest & Great Basin

### Hopi — **Ant People (Anu Sinom)**

Sheltered clans underground between world-cataclysms; taught sprouting beans in caves. First written by Alexander M. Stephen, 1893–94.[^3]

### Northern Paiute — **Si-Te-Cah**

Red-haired cannibal giants on tule rafts; final battle at Lovelock Cave, Nevada. Primary narrative in Sarah Winnemucca’s *Life Among the Piutes* (1883).[^4]

## 3 · Eastern Woodlands

| Nation | Earlier Beings | Notes / First Text |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| Ojibwe & Cree | **Memegwesiwag** | Tiny hairy riverbank stone-workers. Fr. Jean-André Cuoq, 19th c. Algonquin manuscripts.[^5] |
| Haudenosaunee | **Stone-Coats / Genonsgwa** | Flint-armored cannibals; recorded by Seneca author David Cusick, 1828.[^6] |
| Cherokee | **Nunnehi** | Mountain-dwelling immortals giving refuge before calamity. James Mooney, 1900.[^7] |

## 4 · Mesoamerica

### Maya (K’iche’) — **Mud & Wooden People**

Failed proto-humans destroyed by flood; survivors became monkeys (*Popol Vuh*, c. 1550).[^8]

### Yucatec Maya — **Aluxo’b**

Knee-high dwarfs guarding milpas and ruins; linked to the Dwarf-King of Uxmal and referenced in *Chilam Balam* books.[^9]

### Mexica-Aztec — **Quinametzin**

Colossal architects of Teotihuacan and Cholula; wiped out when the “Sun of Rain” ended. Book X, *Florentine Codex*, 1577.[^10]

## 5 · Andes & Southern Cone

| Culture | Elder Race | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Quechua / Inca | **Viracocha's Giants** drowned or petrified for disobedience | Sarmiento de Gamboa, 1572.[^11] |
| Aymara & Quechua | **Gentiles**—pre-Inca stonemasons turned to hills at sunrise | Quechua sermons; Godofredo Taipe, 2003. |
| Mapuche | **Gentiles** again—mountain people petrified into the landscape | Félix José de Auguste-Saint-Hilaire, 19th c. notes. |

## 6 · Patterns

1. **Deep-time memory.** Cataclysm motifs (floods, volcanic winters) sometimes align with late-Pleistocene events.  
2. **Folk archaeology.** Stories cluster around anomalous ruins or mummies later confirmed older than the tellers.  
3. **Human ⇄ Other.** Predecessors slip between physical populations and numinous forces—useful for staking land claims or encoding taboo.

## FAQ

**Q 1. Did any myth get verified by science?** 
**A.** Yes—the Inuit Tuniit map cleanly onto the genetically distinct Dorset Paleo-Eskimos, replaced c. AD 1200.

**Q 2. Are "red-haired giants" at Lovelock Cave real?** 
**A.** Mummies exist, but red coloration is post-mortem; cranial metrics match regular Northern Paiute ancestors, not giants.

**Q 3. How old is the *Popol Vuh* account of pre-human races?** 
**A.** The surviving K'iche' manuscript dates ~1550 CE, but scholars argue it preserves Preclassic oral material centuries older.
