**TL;DR**

- **Breeder's Equation math** shows that even a *tiny* selection differential (-or + 0.1 IQ/generation) compounds fast enough to reshape cognition well inside 50 kyr. 
- **Empirical data** say selection on IQ is ~ ± 0.6–0.8 points / generation *today*, falsifying the "S ≈ 0" premise directly. 
- **Ancient-DNA polygenic scores** climb ≈ +35 IQ since the Early Holocene, matching theoretical expectations for S ≈ 0.2. 
- The "no change since the Palaeolithic" claim is a **religious axiom**, not a scientific inference.

## 1 Quotes & the Blank-Slate Catechism

> "There's been **no biological change in humans in 40 000 or 50 000 years**. Everything we call culture and civilization we've built with the same body and brain." — *Stephen Jay Gould*  [oai_citation_attribution:0‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3721656/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

> "Pre-historic people were *our equals* in mental capacity; the difference is purely cultural." — *David Deutsch*, Within Reason podcast, 2025  [oai_citation_attribution:1‡YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpP9sqbQzjs&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Such pronouncements are treated as self-evident truths in many classrooms. Below I treat them as falsifiable hypotheses and run the numbers.

## 2 The Breeder's Equation on a Beer-Coaster

\[
\Delta Z \;=\; h^{2}\,S
\]

- **ΔZ** – change per generation in the trait mean. 
- **h²** – heritability (≈ 0.5 for IQ[^1]). 
- **S** – selection differential (mean of breeders – population). 

### 2.1 Height sanity-check
If tall fathers average 1 inch above the mean (**S = 1″**), ΔZ ≈ 0.8″/generation. Ten generations (≈ 250 y) would yield +8″—a height none of the world's populations reached. So for height, *Σ S* over 50 kyr must hover near zero.

### 2.2 IQ thought-experiment
Set **S = +1 IQ** (below test-retest error). With h² = 0.5, ΔZ = 0.5. After 10 generations: +5 IQ. After 400 generations (~10 ky): +200 IQ—clearly absurd. Therefore **either S≈0** for most of the past or *Homo sapiens* of 10 ka were **far less sapient**.

## 3 Selection Now: Two Independent Lines

| Data stream | Estimated S (IQ pts/gen) | Note |
|-------------|--------------------------|------|
| Fertility × test scores, UK/US twin data | **-0.8** | Meta-analysis of sibship size vs IQ[^2] |
| Polygenic-score change across U.S. birth-years 1931-1990 | **-0.6** (-0.055 SD) | Genomic selection scan[^3] |

Magnitude ≈ 1 in the *relaxed* selection regime of the late 20th C. Claiming S < 0.1 for every prehistoric generation is special pleading.

## 4 Selection Then: Ancient-DNA Signals

Large aDNA datasets (~7 000 genomes) let us track polygenic scores (PGS) for hundreds of traits. Findings most relevant here:

* **Cognitive PGS rose ~0.5 SD since 10 ka**—≈ +35 IQ if linear scaling holds. [oai_citation_attribution:2‡Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/evolutionary-trends-of-polygenic-scores-in-european-populations-from-the-paleolithic-to-modern-times/E76E2C78FFC3DA9BDEB0BC8E37D9273D?utm_source=chatgpt.com) 
* Half of the **twelve strongest Holocene sweeps** involve cognition-linked traits (educational attainment, intracranial volume, etc.). 
* X-chromosome hotspots such as **TENM1** show selective sweeps dating to < 60 ka, consistent with recursion/phonology tweaks in *post-Neanderthal* humans. [oai_citation_attribution:3‡PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36950386/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) 

Plugging **S ≈ 0.2** into the Breeder's Equation reproduces the +35 IQ trajectory neatly.

## 5 Objections—& Why They Fail

| Blank-Slate Objection | Rebuttal |
|-----------------------|----------|
| **"S = 1 IQ is too high."** | The empirical *magnitude* of S today is ~0.8 | see §3 above. Even S = 0.1 implies nonsensical −100 IQ 10 ka ago. |
| **"h² is low."** | Twin/adoption work → h²(IQ) ≥ 0.5; Turkheimer's First Law[^4]. |
| **"IQ ≠ intelligence."** | True but moot: *all* behavioural traits show substantial h², so substitution doesn't rescue S≈0. |
| **"+5 SD is window-dressing."** | Phase transitions (recursion, language) behave non-linearly; +5 SD on a threshold trait = categorical shift. |
| **"Archaeology already shows symbolism @ 100 ka."** | Early ochre/beads are equivocal; durable, widespread symbolic media explode only in the Upper Palaeolithic (see companion *Sapient Paradox* catalogue). |

---

## 6 Implications

* **Sapient Paradox resolved.** If cognitive horsepower scaled within the last 50 kyr, the lag between anatomy and art dissolves. 
* **Self-domestication timeframe.** Dogs, cattle, maize all domesticated < 10 ky; no reason humans needed 300 kyr for comparable neural rewiring. 
* **Ideological fallout.** Flat-cognitive-landscape models survive by decree, not data—much like BYU's creationist pamphlet in my freshman BIO 101.

## 7 Conclusion

Population genetics, modern fertility data, and ancient genomes converge on one boring conclusion: **intelligence has been under directional selection throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.** The only world in which our brains froze 50 000 years ago is one where intelligence conferred *zero* fitness advantage—a world no hunter-gatherer ever inhabited.

As Darwin delayed *Descent of Man* for fear of outrage, today's scholars tip-toe around the brain. But the genome doesn't care. The numbers are in; the blank slate is out.
