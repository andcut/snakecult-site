**TL;DR**

- Earliest secure chicken bones in the Americas are Spanish, **but** a Chilean layer at El Arenal (^14C ~ 1320-1400 CE) plus matching Polynesian mtDNA keeps the pre-Columbian hypothesis alive. [^oai1] [^oai2]  
- Reservoir corrections, tiny sample size, and possible modern contamination are the main objections. [^oai3] [^oai4]  
- Ethnohistorical hints (Inca rituals, Mapuche words) suggest familiarity with chickens before 1532, yet none are decisive. [^oai5]  
- No other New-World site has yielded definitely pre-1492 Gallus bones, but several “maybes” (Peru, California) are under re-analysis. [^oai6]  
- If genuine, Polynesian mariners likely ferried fowl eastward in the 13-14ᵗʰ c., paralleling the sweet-potato transfer. Otherwise, Europeans get all the credit.

## 1 How the Question Hatched

Spanish chroniclers described **"gallinas de Castilla"** arriving with the conquest, yet a few accounts imply Andean peoples already kept chickens for ritual use. [^oai7] Such testimony is thin, but it planted the seed for archaeologists who later combed South-American middens for bones matching the Old-World junglefowl.

In 2007, Storey et al. electrified the field: a single tarsometatarsus from **El Arenal-1 (Arauco Peninsula, Chile)** yielded an uncalibrated ^14C age of 622 ± 35 BP and a mitochondrial haplotype ("E") known only in prehistoric Polynesia. [^oai8] Suddenly the barnyard bird looked like a trans-Pacific smoking gun.

### 1.1 The El Arenal Debate

Pro-contact camp 
: • Date predates Magellan by a century even after marine-diet corrections. 
 • mtDNA clusters with ancient Polynesian sequences, not Iberian breeds. 
 • Polynesians already moved the sweet potato east-to-west; why not chickens? [^oai9] 

Skeptics 
: • Sample (n = 1) is too small; context disturbed by dune migration. 
 • Reservoir corrections could push the bone post-1492. 
 • Haplogroup E also turns up in modern European stock—possible contamination. [^oai10] [^oai11] 

A 2023 re-excavation refined stratigraphy but, frustratingly, produced **no new chicken remains**, leaving the standoff intact. [^oai12]

### 1.2 The Linguistic & Iconographic Hints

- Mapuche word *achocallo* ("domestic fowl") may predate Spanish loanwords. 
- Inca keros depicting birds with combs are tempting but ambiguous. 
- No Mesoamerican codex shows a clear chicken; turkeys reign supreme.

## 2 Why It Matters

1. **Trans-Pacific Navigation** – Chickens would join sweet potatoes and bottle gourds as commensal tracers of Polynesian blue-water prowess.  
2. **Domestication Pathways** – Distinct mtDNA lineages could reveal parallel breeding histories in isolation.  
3. **Columbian Exchange Nuance** – Not every Old-World staple waited for Iberian sails.

Even if El Arenal dissolves under further scrutiny, the episode underscores how a single bone can scramble grand narratives.

## FAQ

**Q1. Is the El Arenal chicken bone the only pre-Columbian specimen?** 
**A.** Yes—so far it's a lone outlier; every other authenticated New-World chicken dates to after 1500 CE. Ongoing digs in Peru and California have yet to change that.

**Q2. Could reservoir effects explain the early date?** 
**A.** Possibly; a high seafood diet can make bones look centuries older. Adjustments push the age toward the early 1500 s, but not decisively past 1492.

**Q3. Do genetics settle the case?** 
**A.** Ancient mtDNA links El Arenal to Polynesia, yet the same haplotype exists in some modern European breeds, so contamination or convergent ancestry can't be ruled out.

**Q4. What about chicken imagery in Andean art?** 
**A.** Avian motifs abound, but none show the unmistakable comb and wattle of Gallus gallus—iconographic evidence remains ambiguous.
