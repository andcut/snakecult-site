**TL;DR**

- Inuit, Plains, several African, and some Oceanic peoples blame mortality on an elder woman’s choice or mishap.  
- No securely attested **South-American** or **European** examples of the *same* “voting crone” structure.  
- Berezkin (2019) maps the motif to a circumpolar → Plains diffusion cline; African cases form separate clusters.  
- Oceanic variants shift agency: the grandmother’s *error* (skin-shedding) makes death inevitable.  
- The best phylogenetic models use Berezkin’s motif database and Bayesian tree-building (e.g. d’Huy 2013; Berezkin 2016a).

## 1 · Core Arctic–Plains Cluster 

> "**Better to be without day, if so we be without death,**" said one crone. 
> "**Nay – let us have both Light *and* Death!**" answered the other, and **as she spoke, it was so.** 
> —*The Coming of Men, A Long, Long While Ago* (Greenland Inuit) [^oai1] 

### Greenland Inuit (Thule tradition) 
Full tale in Rasmussen 1921, pp. 16-18. Two elder women argue; the second's demand for sunrise overrules immortality.

### Blackfoot (Algonquian Plains) 

> Old Man floated a buffalo-chip: "If it rides, we die only four days." 
> **Old Woman threw a stone** that sank: "Now we die forever, else pity would perish." [^oai2]

Cognate float-test versions: Crow, Gros Ventre, Plains Cree, Sarcee.

| Motif element | Inuit | Blackfoot |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Dual speakers | yes | pair |
| Light ↔ death link | yes | no |
| Float-test | stone vs. none | buffalo-chip vs. stone |
| Explicit ecological logic | no | yes ("room for others") |

## 2 · African Scatter  

Abrahamsson’s monograph (*The Origin of Death*, 1951) collates ~40 Sub-Saharan texts. Nyamwezi example:

> “…it would be **better if people died**, else they could not find wood nor room in their fields,” said **Mbaela**, the first woman, and so death began.  [^oai3]  

Parallel cases: Hausa, Bamum, Ngala, Nuer. Old Woman is often alone; no male counter-voice. Scholars treat these as independent inventions rather than imports.

## 3 · Oceania: Grandmother's Skin 

Banks Islands (Vanuatu):

> "One day **an old woman went to a stream to change her skin**… Her grand-child wailed, not knowing her; she put the old hide back on, and *thereafter men died*." [^oai4] 

Ambrym variant lets two deities debate flaying vs. burial; the **last speaker (a female spirit in some tellings)** wins and introduces death. Old-woman agency here is through **mistake**, not policy.

---

## 4 · South America: Close but Not Quite  

Searches of Berezkin’s catalogue (2023 update) and SINIC/ICANH corpora find **no clear “Old Woman votes for death”** text below Panama. The nearest is the Kurripako (Rio Guainía) myth:

> A **mother** breaks taboo, weeps over her hidden son → he dissolves, and the culture-hero pronounces, “Now death will reign forever.”  [^oai5]  

Here the elder female *causes* death indirectly; there is no deliberative opposition as in the Arctic-Plains type.

## 5 · Has Anyone Modelled This Phylogenetically? 

Yes—largely by Yuri Berezkin and Julien d'Huy.

| Study | Dataset | Method | Result for this motif |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| Berezkin 2009 "Why Are People Mortal?" | 2 600 motifs | Areal presence/absence matrices | Maps an Arctic nucleus; African cases isolate. |
| Berezkin 2016a (*Maths Meets Myths*) | ≥ 4 000 entries incl. A1335.* | Neighbor-Net & MJ networks | Suggests Beringian package diffused south to Plains 12–9 k BP. |
| d'Huy 2013 *Rock Art Research* | 45 myths, Bayesian MCMC | Confirms two clades: Circumpolar and Oceanic skin-shed type. |

None attempts a *global chronogram* confined to "Old Woman = Death," but motif A1335.10-14 ("Elder female brings permanent death") is a node in these papers' output trees.

## 6 · Migration / Diffusion Waves (reported, not inferred)

1. **Initial Paleo-Indian (~15 ka)** – no record of the motif.  
2. **Paleo-Arctic / Beringian (~8–6 ka)** – Berezkin flags first attestations of A1335.* entering Alaska.  
3. **Na-Dene south-push (post-5 ka)** – carries float-test variant toward Interior Plateau.  
4. **Algonquian/Plains spread (last 2 ka)** – Blackfoot et al. pick up “buffalo-chip vs. stone” form.  
5. **Thule/Inuit (~1.2 ka)** – carries Greenland dual-crone cosmogony eastward.  
6. **Independent African regional evolutions** (no dated migration linkage).  
7. **Oceanic Lapita descendants (~3 ka)** – grandmother skin-shed narratives move through Vanuatu/Banks.

(Sequence numbers follow Berezkin 2019’s table 3.)

## FAQ 

**Q1. Why is the motif strong in North America but absent in South America?** 
*A.* Current catalogues show no true Old-Woman‐vote texts south of the Darién; scholars attribute this to cultural drift after separate peopling streams, not to sampling bias.

**Q2. Did Indo-European myths ever use an old woman to create death?** 
*A.* No. European crone figures (Cailleach, Baba Yaga, Pesta) preside over *winter or plague*, but do not debate eternal life.
