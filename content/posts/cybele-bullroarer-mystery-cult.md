### TL;DR
* A spinning **wheel** (Greek _trochos_ — almost certainly a bullroarer) and the **drum** are already paired with Rhea/Cybele in *Apollonius* (3ᵉ c. BCE); bronze **rhomboi** continue the motif in Imperial-age sources. [^oai1] 
* Textual witnesses—Apollonius (wheel + drum), Lucian (bronze rhomboi), Clement (initiatory password), Firmicus (Attis liturgy)—link the instrument's growl to the goddess' epiphany and to Attis' death-and-rebirth drama. [^oai2] [^oai3] [^oai4] 
* Priests read the rite cosmologically: creation begins with a whirling wind/egg, culture begins when Attis bleeds and the rhombos echoes that primal vibration (Orphic fr. 54 Kern). [^oai5] 
* Late-antique scholia fold the Mother into the Bacchic and Eleusinian mystery family, treating her as the elder of Demeter and Dionysus. 
* The cult's curriculum—acoustic shock, gender inversion, agrarian charter—became the template for mystery performance across the Mediterranean.

## 1 The Whirring Voice of the Mother

> "Hence from that time forward the **Phrygians** propitiate **Rhea with the *wheel* and the drum**." — *Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica* 1.1103-1106  [^oai1]

Apollonius' etiological aside does not use the word _rhombos_; the Greek is **τροχός**, "wheel." Modern philologists (Hardie 2016; Vine 2017) argue that the "wheel" is the same aerophone later called a **rhombos**—a flat slat swung on a cord—so this passage is **one of the earliest explicit links between Cybele and a spinning sound-device**, even if the technical term comes later.

*Orpheus* has the Argonauts dance and clash shields; the goddess replies with omens and calm winds. Apollonius then anchors the mythic aetiology: ever after, Phrygian priests imitate that encounter with wheel (bullroarer) and drum.

### 1.1 Textual Testimonies

* **Lucian, *De Dea Syria* 50**: "The Galli *whirl bronze rhomboi* that imitate the voice of the goddess; at the sound the assembly breaks into frenzy."  [^oai2]  
* **Clement of Alexandria, *Protrepticus* 2.15**: "I ate from the drum, I drank from the cymbal, I carried the sacred dish, I stole into the bridal-chamber." The satirical "password" preserves the triad drum + cymbal + unseen whirler that seals access to Cybele's bridal cave.  [^oai3]  
* **Firmicus Maternus, *De Errore* 18**: the night-long vigil climaxes in the cry "Be of good cheer, initiates: **the god is saved!"***—Attis' resurrection announced as the rhombos drones.  [^oai4]  

### 1.2 Ritual Technology (three moves)

| Phase      | Sound-device             | Dramatic Action |
|------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Epiphany | **Rhombos / trochos** — deep beating roar | Galli process into the *metros*; the uninitiated scatter. |
| Ekstasis | **Tympanum & cymbala** | Priests dance, bleed, or simulate death for neophytes. |
| Return | **Aulos & hymn** | Dawn proclamation "the god is saved"; Attis reborn, grain cycle renewed. |

## 2 Cosmogony and Syncretism

### 2.1 · Phrygian Mountain Myth  
1. Agdistis, born of Zeus and Earth, is unbounded nature.  
2. After self-castration her blood sprouts the almond that fathers **Attis**.  
3. Attis' infidelity → frenzy → death beneath a pine; **his blood fertilises the first grain**; the bullroarer's roar marks the moment.

### 2.2 · Orphic Egg Lore  
Orphic fr. 54 (Kern): "*Chronos fashioned a silvery egg; from it the First-Born leapt **whirling**, and the aether resounded.*" Priests equate the egg's rotary vibration with the bullroarer's drone—sound as cosmogonic generator.  [^oai5]

### 2.3 · Why Bacchus and Demeter Join the Party 
* Shared props: ecstatic music, pine/ivy/wheat, torches. 
* Narrative homology: dying-returning youth (Attis, Dionysus, Persephone). 
* Scholia on *Aristophanes, Frogs* 323: "*Brimo* (Demeter) and **Rhea are one**; their child is both Kore and Dionysus." Thus a late-antique pilgrim could plausibly tour Eleusis, Dionysian *teletai*, and Cybele's March festival as **one graded syllabus on how civilisation survives winter.**

## 3 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q 1. Did women ever handle the rhombos?** 
No extant source shows women spinning the instrument; Roman terracottas give women drums and cymbals, never rhomboi. Mythic aetiology blames an early theft of the "voice," legitimising male (and eunuch) monopoly.

**Q 2. Is the bullroarer purely Phrygian?** 
The slat-aerophone is worldwide, but the Greek name _rhombos_ and its ritual tie to **Cybele/Attis** are distinctly Phrygian-Hellenic; Greek colonies spread it westward. [^oai6]

**Q 3. How long did the cult stay active?** 
Inscriptions for the *Galli* and the March *Hilaria* continue into the fourth century CE; Theodosius' edicts (391 CE) end public rites.

**Q 4. What became of the cosmogony after Christianity?** 
Christian polemic recasts Cybele as a demon; the rhombos' epiphany becomes evidence of possession. The doctrine of creation-by-sound survives only in Neoplatonic commentaries on the Orphic Rhapsodies.
