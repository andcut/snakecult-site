|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Author** | **John L. Brooke** (b. 1953), Arts & Sciences Distinguished Professor of History & Warner Woodring Chair at Ohio State University[^1] |
| **Publication data** | Cambridge University Press, 1994 (hardback); paperback re-issue 1996[^2] |
| **Core thesis** | Brooke traces a "hermetic–alchemical" current—from Radical Reformation sects, Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, folk magic, and Christian Kabbalah—into the Burned-over District, arguing that Joseph Smith fused these esoteric strands with Bible primitivism to create distinct Mormon cosmology. |
| **Major awards** | **Bancroft Prize in American History (1995)**—one of the discipline's top honors—awarded for originality and breadth[^3] |

### Reception

| Community | Typical Response | Key Points & Examples |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mainstream historians / American studies** | Largely positive; hailed as bold, interdisciplinary, and path-breaking | *Cambridge* promo calls it "important and daring." Dialogue reviewer Owens: "seminal work… every scholar must now reckon with."[^4] |
| **LDS-aligned scholars & apologists (FARMS, BYU)** | Often sharply critical; accuse Brooke of parallel-omania, factual slips, and ignoring ancient Christian sources | FARMS *Review of Books* ran a 70-page rebuttal (Hamblin, 1996) disputing Hermetic/Kabbalah links as "unsubstantiated."[^5] |
| **Independent Mormon studies & ex-Mormon readers** | Mixed-to-welcoming; credit it with opening serious discussion of Smith's magical milieu | *Juvenile Instructor* blog: suggests a more nuanced reception if published today.[^7] |
| **General readership** | Modest sales; Goodreads rating ~3.9/5 from 100+ readers | Enthusiasts find it dense but rewarding for its esoteric history.[^6] |

**Common accolades**

- "Brilliant synthesis of occult, social, and religious history" (academic panels after the Bancroft) 
- Praised for unearthing forgotten Hermetic/Pietist enclaves (Ephrata Cloister, Rosicrucian-tinged Masonry) 

**Typical criticisms**

- Overstates direct transmission: lacks a "smoking-gun" showing Smith read specific hermetic texts. 
- Conflates Christian Platonism with occultism; factual missteps flagged by FARMS reviewers.
