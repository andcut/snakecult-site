**TL;DR**
- Froese's Ritualised-Mind Hypothesis (RMH) suggests ritual ordeal initiated subject-object separation.
- Eve Theory of Consciousness (EToC) extends RMH with specific catalysts (e.g., venom) and agents (females).
- This synthesis connects RMH/EToC to modern neural theories (GNW, IIT, PP, AST, HOT).

## 1 Problem Statement

Two questions frame the evolution of human consciousness:

1. **Installation** - *How did reflective subject–object separation first become part of hominin development?*
2. **Implementation** - *What neural or informational architecture realises conscious experience in any mind, ancient or modern?*

Tom Froese's **Ritualised-Mind Hypothesis** (RMH) addresses the first.
The **Eve Theory of Consciousness** (EToC) elaborates RMH with concrete agents, substances, and cultural signatures.
Modern neural theories—**Global Neuronal Workspace** (GNW), **Integrated Information Theory** (IIT), **Predictive-Processing / Active Inference** (PP/AI), **Attention-Schema Theory** (AST), and **Higher-Order Thought** (HOT)—tackle the second.

This essay shows how EToC and RMH supply the *evolutionary provenance* those neural theories often leave implicit, and how, reciprocally, those theories clarify the likely neural dynamics of ritual-induced recursion.

## 2 Ritualised-Mind Hypothesis (RMH) in Brief

*Froese & Harnad 2015* argue that puberty-grade **ordeals**—combining sensory deprivation, pain, social isolation, and entheogens—destabilised ordinary sensorimotor coupling. In the resulting altered state, initiates confronted a minimal observer that persisted while bodily experience dissolved. Repetition transformed this insight into a culturally expected developmental stage; natural selection then canalised brains better able to stabilise recursion.

Key claims:

- **Experiential trigger** rather than genetic mutation initiates subject–object separation.
- **Cultural iteration** embeds the new stance in ontogeny.
- **Gene–culture feedback** gradually encodes supporting neural traits.

## 3 Eve Theory of Consciousness (EToC): Extending RMH

EToC, developed in three essays at *Vectors of Mind*, retains RMH's mechanism but specifies:

| Domain | EToC content | Empirical leverage |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Chemical catalyst** | Controlled **snake-venom trance** as a ubiquitous, discoverable entheogen. | Ethnographic reports of venom intoxication; python-shaped ritual site at Tsodilo Hills (~70 ka). |
| **Demography** | **Females** as early adopters and teachers of recursion, reflected in modern sex differences in social cognition. | Precuneus dimorphism; X-linked sweeps (e.g., *TENM1*). |
| **Cultural memory** | **Serpent-and-knowledge myths** preserve the rite's structure. | Near-universal motif across myth corpora (Witzel 2012). |

Thus EToC furnishes RMH with agents, practices, and archaeological–mythic traceability.

## 4 Dialogue with Contemporary Neural Theories

### 4.1 Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)

**Theory.** Conscious access arises when distributed processors ignite a fronto-parietal workspace and broadcast information globally (Dehaene 2023).

**Continuity.** Ritual ordeal floods ascending prediction error, forcing repeated workspace ignition; adolescents thereby practice global broadcast until it stabilises as a trait.

**Devil's-advocate query.** *Does workspace practice require psychopharmacology?*
> **Response.** Strong modulators such as venom reduce the threshold for ignition and make the demonstration reliable; once broadcast training is culturally entrenched, less chemical support may suffice.

### 4.2 Integrated Information Theory (IIT 4.0)

**Theory.** Consciousness is present when a system's cause–effect structure exceeds a critical Φ threshold (Tononi 2024).

**Continuity.** EToC's altered states transiently increase integration between the default-mode network (DMN) and salience/attentional hubs. Iterative rites push developing brains toward architectures with higher baseline Φ.

**Objection.** *If Φ scales with brain size, why is ritual necessary?*
> **Response.** Brain size supplies potential Φ; ritual guides network topology toward realised Φ by strengthening cross-module connectivity during sensitive developmental windows.

### 4.3 Predictive-Processing / Active Inference

**Theory.** Brains minimise free-energy by updating predictive hierarchies with precision-weighted errors (Friston 2023).

**Continuity.** Ordeal destabilises precision allocation: deprivation down-weights exteroceptive priors, pain up-weights interoception, venom perturbs neuromodulators. The system infers a *latent self* as the best model of these mismatched streams, seeding explicit self-representation.

**Devil's-advocate query.** *Could language alone supply the requisite precision shifts?*
> **Response.** Language modifies top-down predictions but seldom overwhelms interoceptive signals; extreme physiological perturbation ensures deeper hierarchical revision.

### 4.4 Attention-Schema Theory (AST)

**Theory.** A schematic model of attention generates the subjective sense of awareness (Graziano 2024).

**Continuity.** Shamans instruct initiates to observe their own attentional spotlight under trance, thereby externalising the schema for metacognitive uptake.

**Challenge.** *Is explicit coaching plausible in prelinguistic societies?*
> **Response.** Gesture, demonstrative ritual, and mimetic enactment suffice to direct attention; cave art entoptic patterns may record such demonstrations.

### 4.5 Higher-Order Thought (HOT)

**Theory.** A mental state is conscious when accompanied by a higher-order representation of that state (Brown 2023).

**Continuity.** Ritual provides repeated episodes in which first-order bodily states are re-represented and narrated post-trance, scaffolding HOT formation before full linguistic syntax.

**Objection.** *Would HOT not require language first?*
> **Response.** Narrative language refines HOT, but non-verbal re-enactment and symbolic marking (body paint, engravings) can ground second-order representation initially.

## 5 Gene–Culture Co-evolution: Predictive Markers

| Prediction | Data source | Current evidence |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Late-Holocene sweeps on recursion-linked genes (e.g., *TENM1*, *DLG2*) | Ancient DNA | Multiple X-linked sweeps reported 2018–2024. |
| Y-chromosome bottleneck (~6 ka) reflects male differentials in recursion acquisition | Demographic genetics | Bottleneck confirmed (Karmin et al. 2015); cause under debate. |
| Dense serpent iconography precedes regional symbolic explosion | Archaeological chronology | Tsodilo Hills python cave (~70 ka) predates major Upper-Palaeolithic art sites. |

## 6 Outstanding Questions and Collaborative Research Paths

- **Neuro-pharmacology.** Systematic mapping of elapid toxins on σ-1 and 5-HT2A receptors during DMN activation.
- **Developmental neuroscience.** Longitudinal studies of extreme-state meditative practices as analogues to adolescent ordeal on functional connectivity.
- **Comparative mythology.** Quantitative test: cultures lacking serpent myths should display later grammaticalisation of self-referential pronouns.
- **Computational modelling.** Implement ritual perturbation schedules in active-inference agents to test emergence of self-models.

## 7 Conclusion

Froese's Ritualised-Mind Hypothesis and the Eve Theory of Consciousness describe *installation events* that plausibly initiated reflective subject–object separation in Late-Pleistocene humans. When placed alongside contemporary neural theories, the combined framework offers:

- A **historical mechanism** for training fronto-parietal broadcast (GNW) and elevating Φ (IIT).
- A **developmental narrative** for inferring a latent self under extreme precision shifts (PP/AI).
- A **pedagogical path** for building attention schemas (AST) and higher-order representations (HOT) before complex language.

In sum, ritual-induced altered states supply the missing diachronic context for theories that are otherwise synchronic descriptions of neural architecture. Conversely, those theories specify the neural dynamics through which ritual and venom could have entrenched recursion. The dialogue between installation and implementation closes the evolutionary account of how minds became aware of themselves.

## FAQ

**Q:** How does the Ritualised-Mind Hypothesis differ from the Eve Theory?
**A:** RMH provides the core mechanism (ritual ordeal -> self-awareness). EToC builds on it, proposing specific agents (females), catalysts (snake venom), and connecting to myth/genetics.

**Q:** What is the main contribution of this synthesis?
**A:** It bridges the evolutionary *installation* of consciousness (RMH/EToC) with modern theories of its neural *implementation* (GNW, IIT, etc.), providing a more complete picture.

**Q:** Is the use of snake venom central to the combined theory?
**A:** Venom is a specific, testable catalyst proposed by EToC, fitting the RMH framework. While plausible, the core mechanism relies on ritual-induced altered states, which could potentially involve other methods.
