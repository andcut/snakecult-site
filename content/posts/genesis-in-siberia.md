**TL;DR**

- Myths of a lost paradise or 'fall from grace' involving humans losing immortality/perfection due to transgression (often involving animals like snakes or dogs) are found across Eurasia (Semitic, Altaic, Uralic) and even Africa.
- Comparative analysis of these motifs (e.g., loss of fur/radiant skin, failed messages, animal tricksters) alongside linguistic links suggests diffusion from a common proto-myth originating in the Paleolithic or early Holocene (~12,000+ years ago).
- Motifs like the World Tree and sacred numbers (seven, nine) also show widespread Eurasian parallels, hinting at a shared ancient cosmology.
- Archaeological evidence (e.g., Göbekli Tepe) and the known longevity of oral traditions (e.g., Aboriginal myths) support the plausibility of mythic continuity over vast timescales, predating known historical diffusion from civilizations like Babylon.
- This suggests a deep, shared human heritage reflected in our oldest stories about origins and mortality.

## Linguistic Pathways of Mythic Diffusion

One of the most intriguing puzzles in comparative mythology is the recurrence of "fall from grace" motifs across vastly separated cultures. From the Samoyedic fringes of Siberia to the Semitic heartlands of the Near East, we find myths in which humanity loses an original perfection or immortality due to a transgression. Could these parallels stem from common ancestry in deep time? Linguistic evidence suggests that as language families spread during the Holocene transition (~12,000 years ago), they carried mythic motifs alongside loanwords and ancestral memories. For example, the Altaic languages (a controversial grouping that includes Turkic and Mongolic) share certain cosmological terms and myth themes, as do branches of the Uralic family like Samoyedic, and even distant Afroasiatic branches like Semitic. The diffusion of myth might have accompanied the diffusion of languages: a migrating tribe not only carries its tongue, but also its tales. As proto-Altaic bands traversed the steppe or early Semitic pastoralists roamed the Levant, they may have transmitted creation myths through both linguistic exchange and intermarriage, leaving etymological footprints alongside narrative ones. Comparative linguists have noted, for instance, striking similarities in words for cosmic concepts and supernatural beings across Turkic and Samoyedic languages, hinting at early contact or common origin ￼. These linguistic overlaps strengthen the case that mythic motifs – like a primordial human garment of light or fur – could have diffused with migrating speech communities. When we see a Turkic tale of an "Edenic" loss mirrored in a Finnic or Siberian folktale, it tempts us to look beyond coincidence or recent borrowing, and instead to a proto-tradition carried along ancient language routes.

Crucially, the migration and interchange of myths need not imply a straightforward, one-time event. Just as words are loaned, myths can be calqued (translated concept-for-concept) or adapted into new cultural lexicons. A Semitic myth of a first man clothed in glory can be retold by a Persian or Turkic neighbor in terms of fur or nails, preserving the structure even as the language changes. Over millennia, the scaffolding of an archetypal story – a paradisiacal beginning, a forbidden act, a loss of innocence – may persist long after the original words are forgotten. Thus, by triangulating linguistic evidence (shared root words, parallel idioms, and myth-related terminology) we see the shadow of a dissemination of myth that corresponds to the branching of language families since the Late Pleistocene. The Altaic, Uralic/Samoyedic, and Semitic groups, despite their differences, all harbor echoes of a story that perhaps was told around campfires in a much earlier era, in a tongue now long extinct but ancestral to those families.

## Comparative Mythic Motifs: From Fur to Fall

The content of these myths strengthens the case for a common source. A remarkable number of cultures have a tale in which humans originally had a protective covering – be it a hide of fur, a radiant skin of light, or a shell of "skin of nails" – and lost it due to a forbidden act or a trick instigated by an animal. In Turkic and Siberian lore, humans were fashioned by the Creator in a state of potential immortality, and their bodies were pristine. A recurring motif among Turkic peoples is that the first humans were made of clay and left to dry, watched over by a trusty dog. In the Mongolic myth of the Altaic peoples, Father Heaven (Tenger) tasked a dog to guard the freshly formed human bodies. Originally, this dog was hairless and could speak. While the Creator was away, an evil spirit (often identified with Erlik, the lord of the underworld) came in the guise of a serpent or demon to inspect these new beings. The vigilant dog, though loyal, was tempted: the intruder offered the dog a fur coat to keep it warm through the cold, in exchange for simply gazing upon the humans. The dog relented – it allowed the serpent/devil near the humans and received a beautiful furry pelt as reward. But this seemingly innocent bargain had catastrophic consequences: the evil one spat on the human forms or otherwise defiled them, robbing them of their intended immortality by afflicting them with disease and death ￼. When the Creator returned, he found both his creation ruined – humans now fated to mortality – and the dog wearing a stolen coat of fur. As punishment, the dog was made to lose its power of speech and carry a foul odor in its fur, doomed henceforth to follow humans as a servant rather than a guardian. In these Altaic variants, we thus see humans losing an original "protective covering" and their chance at perfection, due to a forbidden pact between their guardian (dog) and a tempter (snake/devil). Notably, a very similar motif is found among the Finno-Ugric peoples to the west: in one Mansi and Finnish tale, man was nearly perfect and immortal, until the Devil transferred man's hairy covering to the dog, simultaneously cursing man with mortality by spitting on him. The ubiquity of this storyline – spanning from the Siberian taiga to the Baltic – hints at a shared mythic heritage rather than independent invention.

In the Semitic traditions, the motif takes on a more spiritual form but remains recognizably parallel. Early Jewish and Islamic legends (elaborating on the biblical story of Adam and Eve) describe Adam's original clothing not as fur, but as something wondrous: a radiance or a luminous garment described as a "skin of nails" that shone like daylight. One Midrash (Pirqe de Rabbi Eliezer) explicitly asks: What was the clothing of the first man? The answer: "A skin of nails and a cloud of glory covered him. But when he ate of the fruit of the tree, the skin-of-nails was stripped off and he stood naked". In other words, before the Fall, Adam and Eve's bodies had a hard, shiny covering – often interpreted as being like fingernails or horns – which made them luminous and immortal. After the transgression (eating the forbidden fruit), they lost this covering of glory. Some Jewish traditions add a fascinating twist: God then clothed the exiled Adam and Eve in garments made from the skin of the serpent – effectively a sad reminder of what was lost. In a Targum (Aramaic translation of Genesis), the "garments of skin" that God gives are explained as "garments of honor from the skin of the serpent," replacing the original nail-like skin that had been taken away. Here again is the pattern: humans had a protective integument (a supernatural one in this case), but a snake and a forbidden act caused its removal. All that remains of the primordial covering, says one legend, are the fingernails on human digits – a faint vestige to remind us of our former state.

Strikingly, similar myths are found far outside Eurasia, suggesting a time depth that transcends recorded history. Many African peoples tell a tale of how death became the fate of humans through an animal's error or trickery. The Zulu myth recounts that in the beginning, the Creator (Unkulunkulu) sent a chameleon with the message to mankind that "Men must not die." However, the chameleon was slow and tarried on the way. Growing impatient, the Creator dispatched a speedy lizard (or in some versions, a hare or a dog) with a new message: "Men must die." The swift messenger reached humans first, and thus death was established in the world ￼. When the chameleon finally arrived with the original glad tidings of immortality, it was too late – humans had already accepted mortality as their lot. Variations of this "message that failed" myth stretch across sub-Saharan Africa, with different animals playing the roles (a chameleon and a lizard in Bantu stories, or a dog and a frog in Khoisan tales). In each case, humanity's loss of immortality or a perpetual rejuvenation (often symbolized by the snake shedding its skin) is attributed to a cosmic mix-up or act of disobedience involving animals. Some scholars have pointed out that the African motif of the snake shedding its skin to renew its youth – while humans do not – is an inversion of what was "meant to be." In effect, snakes received the gift of continual renewal that humans were supposed to have. A well-known Khoisan (Bushmen) story tells of the moon sending a message to humans that they will be like the moon – periodically reborn (as the moon waxes anew) – but the hare (or dog) garbles the message to say they will die and not return, and as punishment the moon strikes the hare's lip, splitting it (thus explaining the hare's cleft lip). Though the surface details differ, the core structure aligns with the Eurasian myths: an original plan for human immortality or invulnerability, thwarted by a creature's folly or malice, resulting in our current mortal state.

The sheer geographical spread of these motifs – from the Kalahari to the Siberian tundra, from the Mongolian steppe to the Jordan Valley – strongly suggests they are ancient. It is conceivable that these stories all emanate from a proto-myth told by early Homo sapiens in the Late Paleolithic, which then diverged as populations spread and lost contact. Later historical diffusions (e.g. the spread of Babylonian or Biblical stories) cannot easily explain, for instance, why a Nenets reindeer-herder in Arctic Russia would believe that humans lost their fur to a dog's betrayal, or why a Zulu elder in South Africa would independently hold that a chameleon's delay cost us eternal life. The comparative method reveals a set of mythic archetypes: humans originally radiant or furry; an animal intermediary (snake, dog, chameleon, etc.); a forbidden action (eating a fruit, allowing a demon to spit, delivering the wrong message); and a tragic outcome (the loss of immortality or grace). The consistency of this narrative scaffold hints at common origin rather than chance.

## Sacred Numbers and Cosmic Trees: Seven, Nine, and the World Axis

Beyond the fall-from-grace narratives, another intriguing cross-cultural pattern is the mythological significance of certain numbers (especially seven and nine) and the image of a great tree with differentiated or sacred branches. In many Altaic (Turkic and Mongolian) myths, the structure of the cosmos is described with numeric precision. For example, one Mongolian account speaks of "a nine-story heaven, a nine-story earth, and nine rivers" created in the beginning. The number nine appears repeatedly as a symbol of completeness or cosmic extent – a likely resonance of the number's importance in Central Asian cosmology. Likewise, seven appears as a sacred number: Turkic myths tell of seven suns that once shone and had to be shot down to leave one; and shamans from the Altai to Siberia often described the heavens in seven layers or levels. In fact, the shamanic journey in some Siberian cultures was envisioned as an ascent up a birch tree with seven branches, each branch representing one of the seven heavenly realms ￼ ￼. The World Tree of the shamanic cosmology in these regions was sometimes explicitly said to have seven boughs, often with a bird of prey perched at the top and a serpent coiled at the roots ￼ ￼. Such imagery uncannily recalls other mythic trees – the Norse Yggdrasil with an eagle and a dragon (Nidhogg) at its extremities, or even the Biblical Tree in Eden with a tempting serpent below and, in some Christian interpretations, a dovelike Holy Spirit above. The recurrence of dual guardianship – a creature above and a creature below – in tree-of-life symbols is notable. In Altaic art and legend, this often took the form of an upper-world creature (like a bird, symbolizing the sky or soul) and a lower-world creature (like a snake, symbolizing earth or the underworld) cooperating to guard or constitute the cosmic axis ￼.

The numbers seven and nine themselves invite comparative inquiry. Why should a Buryat shaman speak of nine celestial layers, and an ancient Mesopotamian hymn speak of "the seven heavens", and a medieval Irish text of "the nine hazels of wisdom" by a sacred well? Some researchers have proposed that early Eurasian peoples inherited a kind of numerical mythology from a common source – possibly reflecting astronomical observations (seven visible celestial bodies, phases of the moon, etc.) or simply a shared storytelling device. In Turkic traditions, both seven and nine are holy: medieval Uyghur epics mention nine-branched trees and nine celestial lights, alongside seven being a number of completion for feasts and rites ￼ ￼. The presence of a "Nine-branched Tree of the Cosmos" in Turkic myth, planted by the primordial deity Kayra Khan ￼ ￼, is an especially striking parallel to the world-spanning trees of other cultures. It evokes the idea that deep in the past, a proto-mythology included a cosmic tree connecting heaven and earth with a specific count of branches or levels. This could have been a metaphor for the entirety of the known cosmos – a way to map the spiritual landscape – and the fact that it appears with similar numerical symbolism in far-flung traditions (from the Evenks of Siberia who honor seven branches ￼, to the ancient Near East where the sacred tree was linked to seven heavens ￼, to the Nordic tree with perhaps nine worlds) suggests an ancient continuity rather than late borrowing. Even the dual guardianship of snake and dog can be viewed through this lens: consider the Greek Cerberus, a multi-headed hound often depicted with serpents about his neck and a serpent's tail, guarding the underworld – a possible echo of an older motif pairing canines and serpents as threshold guardians. In Zoroastrian Iranian lore, we find two dogs guarding the Chinvat bridge to the afterlife, and a dragon (snake) as the adversary of the divine. The Altaic dog-and-snake in the creation story (one entrusted with guarding life, the other bringing death) might be a microcosm of this broader symbolic duet of dog = protector of life and snake = emissary of death/renewal.

Numbers like seven and nine likely attained sacred status independently in several cultures, but the specific complex of "seven (or nine) layered cosmos + world tree + snake and bird/dog guardians" is so specific that it points to very old connections. We can imagine an early Holocene myth told by a proto-shaman: he describes a great tree with roots in the underworld and branches holding up the sky's many tiers; he says there is a serpent at the base, maybe the source of earthly knowledge or immortality, and a great eagle or dog-faced guardian higher up; he speaks of the upper world subdivided into seven or nine zones, each perhaps the abode of certain spirits or ancestors. As descendants of that shaman spread out – some to Anatolia and Mesopotamia, some to the Siberian forests, some to the steppes – they retained the broad cosmological picture but adapted it to their local environment and genius. Hence the Mesopotamians give the world-tree branches the number seven (a number richly attested in Babylonian cosmology), the Turkic peoples favor nine (a number deeply embedded in Turkic royal and ritual tradition), yet both stem from a once-unified mythic vision.

## Beyond Babylon: Tracing a Paleolithic Proto-Tradition

It is tempting for scholars to attribute common myths to known historical diffusion – for instance, the spread of Mesopotamian stories through the Fertile Crescent (the way the Epic of Gilgamesh's flood story might have influenced the Hebrew Bible, or how Persian dualism influenced Finno-Ugric myths of God vs Devil). However, the motifs we have surveyed appear far too archaic and widespread to be fully explained by Bronze Age or Iron Age interactions. The fall-from-grace myth with snakes and dogs, and the cosmic tree with sacred numbers, carry an ambiance of the Paleolithic and early Neolithic; they concern fundamental human conditions (life, death, the loss of innocence) and use animals that were among the first companions or adversaries of humans (dogs, snakes, perhaps reflecting early domestication and primordial fear). These qualities hint that the mythic elements were in place before the rise of the classic civilizations of Babylon or Pharaonic Egypt – perhaps by the end of the last Ice Age when hunter-gatherers and proto-farmers in the Near East first began to congregate in larger communities and formulate elaborate cosmologies.

The argument for a Paleolithic or early Holocene source is bolstered by considering what we know of that transitional period. Around ~12,000 years ago, climates were shifting dramatically as the Ice Age ended. Human populations experienced upheavals: sea levels rose, game migrations changed, and crucially, the first experiments with settled life and agriculture took place. This is the era of Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Anatolia (modern Turkey) – a monumental ceremonial site dated to around 9600 BCE (over 11,000 years ago) where early societies built stone circles with towering T-shaped pillars adorned with carvings of animals. Notably, among the rich carvings at Göbekli Tepe, we find reliefs of snakes (in abundance), snarling beasts, birds of prey, and abstract totemic figures. One pillar famously shows a carved bas-relief of what appears to be a cosmic tree or pole with branches, flanked by mysterious figures and animals. While we cannot "read" these carvings as a direct text, they strongly indicate a cosmology in which these creatures played symbolic roles. It is tantalizing to think that the priests or shamans of Göbekli Tepe, who gathered under the hilltop sanctuaries at the threshold of the Holocene, might have been telling stories about a great tree that held up the sky, about how mankind once communed with the animals but fell from favor. Southeastern Anatolia, at the nexus of continents, could well have been a cradle of myth where the ancestors of different peoples (some who would become Indo-European, some Semitic, some maybe Altaic-leaning tribes moving northwards) exchanged and elaborated tales during the dawn of agriculture.

The spread of Neolithization – the transition to farming – from the Near East outward provides a mechanism for mythic spread. As agriculture radiated from Anatolia and the Levant into Europe (the Anatolian farmer migration) and eastward into Iran and Central Asia, it brought not just new subsistence methods but also ritual practices and mythic frameworks tied to the cyclical patterns of sowing and reaping, life and death. Myths of a lost golden age or a primal fall might resonate with early agriculturalists' memory of a hunter-gatherer paradise lost; the motif of humans once having a coat of fur or scales could even echo a dim recollection of times when humans lived more like wild creatures among animals. Some anthropologists have speculated that the Edenic fall myth (man loses immortality by sin) symbolically reflects the transition from a carefree foraging life in harmony with nature to the toilsome life of farming, burdened by labor and mortality. Whether or not one subscribes to that specific interpretation, it is clear that as Neolithic culture spread, so did complex religious ideas. We see continuity of certain symbols: the snake, for instance, becomes the emblem of earth's regenerative powers in many early farming cults (from the Near Eastern mother goddess iconography to Chinese myths of Nuwa). Yet the snake is also the deceiver in Eden and the spitter in the Siberian tales – suggesting a very old ambivalence attached to this creature, one that could have been hashed out in proto-Neolithic cults. Southeastern Anatolia's early sites and the Levantine corridor (home to the Natufian culture, early domesticators of the dog around 14,000 years ago) stand out as a likely mythogenic zone: the place and time where human-animal relations (like the dog's newfound role as man's partner, or the snake's presence in the first settled villages) were negotiated in mythic terms.

By positing a proto-tradition around the start of the Holocene, we can better explain why these motifs are so refractory to later influences. For example, the Altaic "dog's betrayal" myth does not neatly map onto any known written source from Mesopotamia or elsewhere; it seems to have a life of its own, passed down orally on the steppe. If it were only a late borrowing from, say, a Zoroastrian or Christian source, we would expect more telltale signs (such as specific names or moralizing elements) common to those literate traditions. Instead, the tale feels elemental, almost like a just-so story with a moral ("do not trust the Tempter", "this is why dogs smell bad", etc.) grafted onto a cosmological loss. That earthy, explanatory character is typical of very old oral traditions. Similarly, the African stories of the failed message of immortality are likely extremely ancient – some scholars have argued they could date back to humanity's original exodus from Africa, tens of thousands of years ago, given that versions are found in both Africa and Melanesia. While that might be speculative, it underlines a key point: myths can endure far longer than we once thought, surviving through linguistic changes and migrations.

## Archaeological and Deep-Time Corroborations

The archaeological record, though mute, offers clues that bolster the plausibility of deep mythic continuity. We've mentioned Göbekli Tepe as one such clue, with its carved menagerie and possibly symbolic architecture. Another site, Çatalhöyük (in Anatolia, 7th millennium BCE), features murals and figurines including leopards and a divine female figure – perhaps early iterations of later mythology. As farming spread, so did certain symbols: painted pottery of the early Near Eastern farmers often includes snakes and a "tree of life" motif with ramifying lines. In the steppe and Siberia, the earliest layers of indigenous religion (as reconstructed from later folklore) speak of a world before the present order, of sky pillars and world trees, suggesting the concept may date to when those regions were first settled by modern humans at the end of the Ice Age. The continuity of myth is further supported by the field of archaeogenetics: we now know that there were significant population movements in prehistory that could carry myths with them. For instance, genetic evidence shows an expansion of peoples from the Near East into Europe and Central Asia during the early Neolithic. If those people carried a myth of a lost paradise or a sacred tree, they may have sown the seeds of that myth wherever they went. Later, the Yamnaya (Proto-Indo-Europeans of the steppe, c. 3000 BCE) expanded far and wide, likely bringing their own sky-god and dragon-slayer myths which might have syncretized with older Near Eastern ones – but intriguingly, even Indo-European myth has latent traces of the "lost immortality" motif (for instance, the Greek myth of Zeus taking away the immortality of the Silver Age, or the Vedic myth of the snake and eagle fighting over the ambrosia of immortality).

To push the timeframe further, we might consider what evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists term the "sapient paradox" – the puzzling gap between the emergence of Homo sapiens (anatomically modern humans by ~200,000 years ago) and the full expression of modern behavior and culture much later. Professor Colin Renfrew dubbed it the Sapient Paradox: why did it take so long for humans to develop agriculture, cities, and high civilization, even though our brains were ready much earlier? One proposed answer is that humans lived in the richly symbolic mode of mythology and ritual long before civilization, but those mythic frameworks only gradually gave rise to material changes. In other words, our Paleolithic ancestors 40,000 years ago were already weaving complex myths – perhaps about the origins of death, the role of animals, the structure of the cosmos – yet those myths lived in oral culture, leaving scant archaeological trace until they began to be expressed in durable forms (like the stone pillars of Göbekli Tepe or the cave paintings of Lascaux). The Sapient Paradox allows for the possibility that the same story could be told for tens of thousands of years, especially if it had ritual importance. If Aboriginal Australians can transmit accurate descriptions of coastal geography for 7,000 years in songlines ￼ ￼, it is not implausible that a myth about why humans die (as fundamental a question as any) could persist for 12,000 years or more. In fact, Aboriginal Dreamtime stories themselves often contain elements of a primeval time when humans were not yet fully human, when animals and people shared forms – a concept not unlike the Eurasian idea of an original state of oneness and subsequent fall or separation. Some Dreamtime narratives speak of ancestral beings who gradually "fixed" the world into its current form, sometimes through mistakes or transgressions, after which the direct communication between humans and the spiritual realm was severed. This resonates with the notion of a lost golden age or a fall from grace.

Moreover, the continuity of myth is supported by recent findings that some Aboriginal tales accurately encode events like volcanic eruptions that occurred around 37,000 years ago ￼ – possibly the oldest true-to-event narratives known. If human societies can preserve the memory of a volcanic eruption for thirty millennia, they might also preserve more abstract narratives over comparable spans. Mythology, it turns out, can be among the most durable cultural artifacts – more enduring than any one language or empire.

All these pieces – linguistic distributions, comparative motifs, archaeological hints, and extreme cases of oral longevity – converge on a provocative conclusion: that the fall-from-grace and creation myths across Eurasia (and even beyond) likely derive from a common proto-tradition rooted around the start of the Holocene, if not earlier. This tradition would have arisen in the crucible of the post-glacial world, perhaps in or near the Fertile Crescent where so many deep lineages of culture intersect. As people moved, traded, and told stories, the proto-myth ramified into local variants, but it never quite died out because it spoke to universal human concerns. The snake and the dog, creatures that share our habitat and fired our imagination, became enduring symbols – sometimes villains, sometimes helpers – in explaining our mortal condition. The numbers seven and nine rode along with early ritual knowledge, possibly mnemonic keys in shamanic teaching songs that in time became cosmological fact in myth. And the image of the great tree stood tall in the human psyche, a natural symbol to connect earth and heaven and to map the unseen architecture of the spiritual world.

## The Sapient Paradox and Dreamtime: Mythic Continuity in Deep Time

To fully appreciate the time depth we are proposing, one must widen the perspective to include how myth and ritual function in traditional societies. Myths are not merely entertainment; they often form the charter for a culture's worldview and identity, especially in non-literate societies where knowledge must be memorized and performed. The stronger the societal reliance on a myth (for example, to explain why we must die, or why we have to perform certain funerary rites to deal with that reality), the more incentive there is to faithfully transmit it across generations. This conservative force can make myth frameworks surprisingly stable. Anthropologist Polly Wiessner's studies of hunter-gatherer firelight stories, for instance, show that moralizing or origin stories are told with great care for accuracy and are less subject to change than, say, daytime gossip. Now, consider that all humans experienced the "fall from grace" of mortality – every culture has to grapple with death's origin. It stands to reason that a compelling explanation, once formulated, would be retained with special tenacity. The Dreamtime concept among Australian Aboriginal peoples embodies this idea of continuity: the Dreamtime is a sacred era in which the world was shaped, and by ritually singing the songs and telling the stories, the people keep the world's blueprint in memory. We might say that for many Eurasian cultures, there was a kind of Dreamtime or mythic age concept as well – a time when humans conversed with animals, did not yet wear skins or clothes, perhaps glowed with an inner light, until a transgression changed everything. By ritually retelling how that transgression happened (whether it was Eve biting the apple or the dog accepting the fur coat or the chameleon dawdling), each culture reaffirms the rules that now govern life (mortality, toil, the need to behave, etc.). Such core stories are not easily jettisoned; they adapt, yes, but in very conservative ways.

This is where the Sapient Paradox meets the mythology: it might be that sophisticated myths long preceded agriculture and cities, and rather than myth being a late byproduct of civilization, civilization was partly an outgrowth of long-held myths that provided a framework for larger social organization. Renfrew's paradox highlights that for tens of thousands of years, humans had the same brains capable of art, religion, and complex society, but they mostly lived in small bands. What changed? One view is that cumulative culture – including mythic narratives – gradually crossed a threshold where large-scale cooperation (through shared belief) became possible. It's conceivable that the belief in a common origin and a fall from grace was one such widespread idea that helped unite early Holocene communities. If neighboring tribes believed they all came from the same First Ancestor who lost immortality, they might feel some kinship or at least understand each other's rituals (much as disparate Polynesian islands shared origin myths that eased inter-island understanding). Thus, proto-myths could be a glue that predates and anticipates the more material glue of agriculture or writing.

The presence of Dreamtime analogues in Eurasia reinforces that mythic continuity can span incredible time depths. Consider the possibility that the "skin of nails" idea in the Adamic story – which likely reached written form in Late Antiquity – might actually preserve a memory of a belief from the Fertile Crescent's Pre-Pottery Neolithic, which in turn might hark back to shamanic symbols of the Upper Paleolithic. After all, Upper Paleolithic cave art often features humans with animal attributes and vice versa; some theorists interpret certain cave paintings as depicting shamans half-transformed into beasts or vice versa. This is thematically related to the concept that the first people had animalistic qualities (fur, claws, etc.) which they later shed. Perhaps an original storyteller around a hearth, noticing how snakes shed their skin or how insects molted, spun an analogy: "Once upon a time, men and women could slip out of their skin and be young again like that snake, but because they disobeyed the High God, now only the snake can do this and we cannot." That storyteller's audience remembered it, told it to their children, and 500 generations later, even after migrating to new lands and speaking new languages, the descendants are still telling essentially that story – now maybe saying "Adam and Eve once had a shining second skin, but lost it when they sinned," or "Our ancestors were hairy and immortal until the trickster spoiled things." Such is the power and endurance of myth.

## Conclusion

Drawing together the threads of linguistics, comparative mythology, and archaeology, we arrive at a portrait of a shared Eurasian (and perhaps pan-human) proto-myth: a grand narrative formulated in the misty dawn of the Holocene, when glaciers retreated and the first temples were raised. This narrative encompassed the origin of the world, the special place of humans in it, and the reason for our mortality. Its key motifs – a primeval state of grace (often symbolized by a physical covering like fur, radiant skin, or long nails), a transgression or error often involving animal interlocutors (a snake that tempts, a dog that fails its duty, a chameleon that arrives late), and the resultant loss of immortality or glory – reverberate through the myths of dozens of cultures separated by vast distances and thousands of years. The recurrence of sacred numbers (seven and nine) and the image of a cosmic tree with guarded levels further point to a coherent myth-structure that was astonishingly widespread. While later historical contacts and borrowings (such as the influence of Mesopotamian civilization or world religions) certainly redistributed and re-emphasized some of these stories, they cannot wholly account for the deep commonalities we've surveyed. Instead, those commonalities are best explained by a common origin: a myth or set of myths told by early modern humans, likely in or around Near Asia (the crossroads of Africa, Europe, and Asia), which has survived in fragmentary but recognizable form to this day.

In essence, the fall-from-grace myths and creation stories of Eurasia are like linguistic cognates – related words in different languages stemming from one proto-word. Just as linguists reconstruct proto-languages by comparing daughter languages, we can attempt to reconstruct aspects of a proto-mythology by comparing these narrative cognates. Doing so suggests that humanity's oldest stories have truly ancient roots, going back not just to the Bronze Age or Neolithic mythologies we often credit (like those of Sumer or Babylon), but to a preliterate cosmology of the Paleolithic-Epipaleolithic hunter-foragers who witnessed the end of the Ice Age. These ancient people, encountering a world of dramatic change, apparently formulated stories so profound and memorable that all the vicissitudes of history since have not erased them, only transformed them.

The implications of such longevity in myth are profound. It means that when we read a line in Genesis about a serpent and a fall, or hear a Siberian elder recount how the dog lost its voice, we might be catching a direct glimpse of the mind of our remote ancestors – a continuous thread of imagination and meaning connecting us to those who lived 500 generations ago. It also underscores a common human heritage: at the level of myth, there are fewer true strangers than we think. A Sumerian peasant, a Viking skald, a Turkic nomad, and a San bushman could all commiserate over the lost chance at immortality and nod at the cleverness (or treachery) of the animals that sealed our fate. In a time when we seek what unites humanity, perhaps one place to look is our oldest legends – for in those venerable tales, we all share the memory of a long-ago paradise, and the dream (or regret) of what we might have been.

## FAQ <!-- retains FAQPage schema support -->

**Q1. What is the article’s central claim?**  
**A.** A “fall-from-grace” proto-myth—loss of immortality after a transgression involving animals—was already circulating across Eurasia (and even Africa) in the late Paleolithic / early Holocene and later branched into the diverse creation stories we know today.

**Q2. What evidence suggests a shared origin rather than parallel invention?**  
**A.** Overlapping motifs (radiant skin/fur lost, snake-or-dog trickster, cosmic tree with 7- or 9-layer heavens) appear in Semitic, Altaic, Uralic, and Bantu lore; similar myth-keywords cluster along Holocene language-family dispersals, and early Neolithic sites (e.g., Göbekli Tepe) depict the same animals and tree symbolism.

**Q3. Why are the snake and dog so prominent across versions?**  
**A.** Both animals stood at the human–wildlife threshold: snakes embodied danger and cyclical renewal (skin-shedding), while early-domesticated dogs policed camps. Myths cast them as guardians/traitors to dramatize humanity’s lost chance at perpetual life.

**Q4. What’s with the sacred numbers seven and nine?**  
**A.** They likely encoded shamanic cosmology—tiers of heaven, branches of the World Tree—and served as mnemonic anchors; the same numeric cosmogram resurfaces from Siberian birch-pole rites to Mesopotamian “seven heavens,” pointing to deep continuity.

**Q5. How can an oral myth survive 10,000 + years?**  
**A.** High-stakes origin stories become ritual liturgy: repeated in initiations, sung as genealogies, and attached to moral taboos. Ethnographic cases (e.g., Aboriginal sea-rise tales accurate after 7 ky) show that tight ritual transmission can preserve narratives across millennia.
