**TL;DR**

- Sanskrit **jñā-**, Greek **gnō-/gnosis**, Latin **(g)nosco**, and English **know** all descend from the Proto-Indo-European verbal root *ǵneh₃-* 'to perceive, recognize'. 
- Regular sound shifts (Grimm's, Verner's, palatalization, loss of laryngeals, etc.) fully explain the divergent modern forms. 
- Semantic drift stayed remarkably narrow: "to know", "cognition", "recognize", "learn". 
- The root underlies *diagnosis*, *ignore*, *noble*, *notice*, and scores of other everyday words you never suspected. 
- South Asian philosophies preserved the root in **jñāna** as a technical term for liberating insight, while the Greek mystery cults and early Christian writers elevated **gnōsis** to a similar soteriological status.

## 1 The Proto‑Indo‑European Root *ǵneh₃‑*

**Reconstruction.** PIE *ǵneh₃‑* (alternating o‑grade *ǵnoh₃‑*) is established on the basis of securely cognate forms across Indo‑Iranian, Hellenic, Italic, Germanic, Celtic, Balto‑Slavic, and Anatolian branches.[^1] Its basic gloss is “to perceive (with the mind), come to know”.

**Ablaut & Laryngeals.** The laryngeal *h₃* colored preceding vowels to *o* in o‑grade formations and was later lost or surfaced as labial coloring in daughter languages (e.g., Greek γι‑/γνω‑). The palatovelar *ǵ* produced Sanskrit *j ñ*, Greek *g(n)*, and Germanic *k/kn* via different branch‑specific developments.[^2]

### 1.1 Morphological Relatives

| PIE Form | Meaning | Sanskrit | Greek | Latin | Proto‑Germanic |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|-------|----------------|
| *ǵn̥h₃-é-ti* | 'he knows' (present) | **jānāti** | **γιγνώσκει** | **gnōscit** | *kunnaiþi* |
| *ǵnō-s-is* | 'act of knowing' (noun) | **jñā́s-** | **gnō̂sis** | **gnōsis** (loan) | — |
| *ǵnō-tós* | 'known, famous' (PPP) | **jñāta-** | **gnōstós** | **notus** | *kundaz* |

## 2 Sound Changes Branch by Branch

1. **Indo‑Iranian:** PIE palatovelar *ǵ* → Sanskrit palatal **j**, while cluster *ǵn* yielded **jñ** via nasal assimilation. Loss of laryngeal produced long vowel in *jñā‑*.[^3]  
2. **Hellenic:** Preservation of voiced velar stop before nasal created **gn‑** cluster; aspirated vocalic syllabics became **gi‑** in Attic present *γι‑γνώσκω*.  
3. **Italic:** Initial **g‑n‑** cluster simplified early, then g‑ dropped in many Romance reflexes (*conoscere*, *connaître*).  
4. **Germanic:** Grimm’s Law devoiced *ǵ* → *k*; nasal assimilation kept **kn‑** in Proto‑Germanic *knēwaną*, later losing /k/ in Modern English *know*.[^4]  
5. **Balto‑Slavic & Celtic:** Show parallel reflexes (*znati*, *adnáim*) illustrating regular s‑/z‑ developments from *ǵn‑* via assibilation.

## 3 Semantic Pathways: From Perception to Salvific Insight

Despite 5,000 + yrs of divergence, the semantic nucleus "mental grasping" stuck. Yet two fascinating specializations emerged:

- **South Asian Philosophy.** In the Upaniṣads and later Vedānta, **jñāna** became the technical term for intuitive, liberating "knowledge-experience" that dissolves *avidyā* (ignorance).[^5] 
- **Greek Mysteries & Christianity.** **Gnosis** entered the lexicon of mystery cults (Orphic, Pythagorean) and then the heterodox Christian currents labelled "Gnostic". Here too, *gnōsis* is redemptive knowledge revealing the divine spark.[^6]

The parallel sacralization of a mundane verb across distant cultures is—if not proof of Jungian archetypes—at least an etymologist's cosmic joke.

## 4 Hidden Cognates You Meet Every Day

| Word | Branch | Intermediate Form | Sense Shift |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| *diagnosis* | Greek → Latin | *dia-gnōsis* "through-knowing" | clinical identification |
| *ignore* | Latin | *(i)gnōrāre* "to not know" | disregard |
| *noble* | Latin | *gnōbilis* "well-known" | aristocratic |
| *notice* | Latin | *notitia* "being known" | observation |
| *cunning* | Proto-Germanic | *kunn-ingaz* "knowing one" | slyness |

## 5 FAQ

**Q1. Why does English *know* drop the initial *k* in pronunciation?**  
**A.** After Middle English, word‑initial /kn/ clusters simplified to /n/ (a type of consonant cluster reduction), but spelling fossilized, leaving the silent *k*.

**Q2. Are *knowledge* and *acknowledge* related?**  
**A.** Yes. *Knowledge* is a native noun derived from *know*; *acknowledge* adds the prefix *ac‑* (< *ad‑*) “to” + *know* + *‑ledge* (noun suffix), meaning “to make something known”.

**Q3. Is Latin *novus* ‘new’ part of the same family?**  
**A.** No. *Novus* comes from PIE *néwos* and is unrelated despite superficial resemblance.

**Q4. Does *cognition* share the same root?**  
**A.** Absolutely. Latin *cognoscere* “to get to know” → *cognitio* “knowledge”, whence *cognition*.
