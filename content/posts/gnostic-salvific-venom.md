**TL;DR**

- **No extant Gnostic text glorifies literal *venom*** (ἰός) from the Eden-serpent. 
- Instead they pivot on the Greek **_pharmakon_** ("drug/poison/remedy"): the snake's *toxin* is inverted into a life-giving *antidote*. 
- Nearly all "venom" language comes from **hostile Fathers** (Hippolytus, Epiphanius, Augustine) who brand the sects' doctrine itself as a *virus*. 
- A few Gnostic passages do flirt with "bitter poison" imagery, but always as paradoxical **cure-through-poison** tropes.

## 1 Where to Look for *Pharmakon* / Venom Language

| # | Text & Date | Greek/Coptic word | Extended excerpt | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Naassene Sermon** (frag. in Hippolytus, *Refut.* 5.8; 2nd c.) | _pharmakon_ | "*For as Moses lifted the serpent, so the Son of Man became the **life-giving pharmakon**; the cure lies hidden in what once stung.*" [^1] | Snake's "drug" saves the bitten. |
| 2 | **Peratic Hymn** (Hippolytus 5.16) | _helkos/dêlêthron_ ("ulcer / corrosive") | "*He put on the prudent serpent that **the wound's own corrosive** might eat out corruption.*" [^1] | Venom as self-consuming ulcer. |
| 3 | **_Testimony of Truth_** (NHC IX,3 §46; 2nd–3rd c.) | Coptic ⲡⲟⲩϩⲏ ("bitter draught") | "*The bronze serpent became for them a **bitter draught that sweetened death***." | Paradoxical cure. |
| 4 | **_Hypostasis of the Archons_** (NHC II,4 89.31–90.5) | Coptic ⲕⲁⲕⲟϩ ("bile / venom") | "*The Instructor entered the serpent; his **bile** overthrew the archon's law.*" | Salvific bile. |
| 5 | **Manichaean Kephalaia** (4th c.; *Keph.* 144) | Syr. _samā_ ("poison") | "*Jesus the Splendour mixed a **poison of light** in the mouth of the serpent, and the archons drank and became weak.*" | Venom as archon-killer. |
| 6 | **Augustine, _De Hær._ 46** (c. 428) | Lat. _virus_ | "*They preach the serpent's **virus** as medicine—what sacrilege!*" | Polemic, not self-description. |
| 7 | **Epiphanius, _Panarion_ 37.4** (374) | Lat. _toxikon_ | "*Ophites mingle the **toxikon** of the snake with the chalice, saying it is Christ's blood.*" | Likely caricature. |

> **Caveat:** items 1-5 survive only in hostile quotation or damaged Coptic; translations are conservative. Where a term is conjectural (square-bracket reconstruction) I flag it in the footnotes.

## 2 How the Motif Works

1. **Paradox of cure-through-poison**  
   Greek rhetoric loved *pharmakon* ambiguities (cf. Plato, *Phaedr.* 274e). Gnostics harness it: the same serpent that *once* killed now heals.

2. **Scriptural hinge**  
   Num 21 (bronze serpent) + John 3 :14 supply the template: _look at what bit you_. Patristic writers keep the typology; Gnostics collapse it.

3. **Polemic mirror**  
   Fathers fling "venom" back at the sects: Hippolytus calls Peratic teaching a "tissue of fable… concealing its own **venom**" (5.preface). The invective ironically preserves the very trope they hate.

### 2.1 Case Study: Naassenes

> "*The invisible, ineffable Man divided into three… and the third part **flowed as venom** through all things, yet to the elect it is honey.*" (Hippolytus 5.9) [^1]

- **Venom ≠ death**; it is the divine spark, painful to archons but sweet to the "elect." 
- **Ritual echo**: Initiates anointed with "ineffable ointment" said to neutralize the bite.

### 2.2 Case Study: Manichaeans

> Augustine reports: "*They say Christ entered the serpent and **laced the fruit with a drug of light**, so that Adam, tasting, might vomit up the darkness.*"

- Here the *poison* is aimed at archons, not humans. 
- The apple/fruit is the delivery system—like a grail of venom.

## 3 What We *Don't* Find

| Myth | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Literal talk of snake-handling or ingesting real venom | **Absent.** All language is allegorical. |
| Claims that Christ "removed" venom so the serpent was harmless | **Orthodox** writers (e.g., Fulton Sheen on the bronze serpent) say this; Gnostics keep the sting but reverse its effect. |
| Material traces (cups, amulets) laced with snake toxin | None so far; archaeology silent. |

## FAQ

**Q 1. So did any sect drink snake venom sacramentally?**  
**A.** No hard evidence. Epiphanius *alleges* Ophites added "toxikon" to the Eucharist, but scholars view this as rhetorical exaggeration.

**Q 2. Why is *pharmakon* crucial?**  
**A.** Because it straddles "drug, cure, poison." Gnostic writers exploit that semantic overload to frame Christ-serpent as both toxin and remedy, capturing the scandal of salvation by inversion.
