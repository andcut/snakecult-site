**TL;DR**

- Campbell loved Jung for hermeneutics, **not** for origin stories.  
- From *Primitive Mythology* (1959) onward he frames Near-East ➜ global motifs as a "single base" diffusion.[^1]  
- He jettisons "psychic unity" whenever radiocarbon dates and trade winds line up—famously the pig/bull/horse package across Eurasia and into Peru.[^2]  
- Interviews (*An Open Life*, 1990) repeat the mantra: "I'm **much more interested in diffusion** … than Jung ever was."[^3]  
- The *Historical Atlas* (1983-88) opens with a map-heavy prologue titled "Diffusion, Convergence, and Parallelism."[^4]  
- Net result: Campbell's default model is caravans, outrigger canoes, and intermarriage; archetypes only explain *resonance*, never *distribution*.

## 1 · Psychic Unity vs. Diffusion: The Ground Rules

Long before "meme" entered the vernacular, two rival heuristics fought for explanatory turf:

| Camp | Core Claim | Usual Suspects |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Psychic Unity** | Humans share deep-structure archetypes that surface independently everywhere. | Bastian, Freud, Jung, Boasian "parallelism." |
| **Diffusionism** | Similar stories travel along real highways (rivers, caravan trails, sea-lanes). | Tylor (late career), Heine-Geldern, Frobenius—and, quietly, Campbell. |

Campbell never repudiates archetypes; he just refuses to let them shoulder the *whole* load. Myths rhyme cross-culturally because brains are similar **and** because sailors get around. The rest of this article follows the paper trail.

## 2 · 1959: *Primitive Mythology* Kills the Psychic-Unity Monopoly

### 2.1 "Parallelism or Diffusion?" (ch. 5)

Pages 202-203 read like a polite throat-punch to isolationists:

> "The ancient civilizations of the Old World … **derived from a single base**…the probability of a *world-wide diffusion* from the Near East…has been argued with bountiful documentation."[^1]

He goes on to show Malayo-Polynesian numerals and pig-cult rites converging on a Near-Eastern seed.

### 2.2 "The Great Diffusion" (ch. 10)

By p. 444 Campbell ridicules the Jung-only reading:

> "The **purely psychological** reading of these parallels **will not do at all**, since a clearly…documented historical sequence has to be recognized…"[^2]

He ticks through kurgan barrows, Yangshao pottery, Javanese seafarers, and Huaca Prieta gourds—each stamped with the same sacrificial-pig complex.

## 3 · 1962-68: *Masks of God* Expands the Web

- **Oriental Mythology** (1962) doubles down, tracing rice-cult and serpent worship eastward.  
- **Occidental Mythology** (1964) drags the bull-games of Crete into a trans-Mediterranean exchange network.  
- **Creative Mythology** (1968) concedes archetypes for creativity but not for historical provenance.

*Net-net*: diffusion is now Campbell's **null hypothesis** for any tight motif cluster.

## 4 · Lectures & Interviews: Campbell vs. the Jungians

> "I'm **not a Jungian**…I'm **much more interested in diffusion and relationships historically** than Jung was, *very, very much so*." —*An Open Life*, p. 119[^3]

The line first surfaces in early-1970s lectures (*Myths to Live By*) and becomes a stock answer whenever interviewers label him "Jungian."

## 5 · 1983-88: The *Historical Atlas* Makes It Cartographic

Volume 2, Part 1 (Way of the Seeded Earth) opens with a 40-page prologue:

> **"Diffusion, Convergence, and Parallelism in the Formation of Cultures."**[^4]

Maps plot crop packages, megalith alignments, and calendrical systems radiating from two primary hearths: the Fertile Crescent and South-China Seas. Psychic unity? Mentioned only to explain why migrants adopted foreign cults so readily.

## 6 · Side Essay: "Symbol Without Meaning" (1957 → 1969)

In this Eranos paper (later in *Flight of the Wild Gander*), Campbell tackles Upper-Paleolithic Venus figurines:

> "...the span Pyrenees to Baikal is **too coherent to be spontaneous invention**; *diffusion, not concurrent creativity, is overwhelmingly suggested*."[^5]

He keeps the archetype (Mother/Death/Rebirth) but nails its spread to Magdalenian trade nets.

## 7 · Methodological Takeaways

1. **Layer Cake Model**  
   - **Psychological layer**: innate "inherited images" à la Jung.  
   - **Historical layer**: seafaring, migration, and empire.  
   Campbell says you need **both**, but the second decides the *where/when*.

2. **Radiocarbon > Reverie**  
   Dates trump dreamwork. If a motif jumps oceans *after* navigable outriggers appear, assume canoes before collective unconscious.

3. **Follow the Pigs**  
   His favorite diffusion tracer is the sacrificial-pig complex: Near East ➜ Indus ➜ Java ➜ Melanesia ➜ Peru.

## FAQ <!-- retains FAQPage schema support. Produce 2–5 Q-A pairs. -->

**Q 1. Did Campbell ever abandon Jung's collective unconscious?**  
**A.** No. He keeps Jung for *meaning* but rejects it as a sole driver of *spread*; diffusion supplies the logistics.

**Q 2. Is "Hero's Journey" a diffusionist claim?**  
**A.** Not really. Monomyth is a narrative *schema*; its global presence is explained by shared cognition **plus** millennia of story-exchange.

**Q 3. Where can I see Campbell's diffusion maps?**  
**A.** Volume 2, Part 1 of the *Historical Atlas of World Mythology* reproduces them in full color—look for the prologue section cited above.
