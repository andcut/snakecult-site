## An Everlasting Gospel from the Beginning

From its founding, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has claimed it is not a new religion but a restoration of God's original, primeval religion. In LDS belief, there is a single everlasting gospel or truth of God that never changes, revealed in every age or dispensation of time[^1]. Early leaders taught that "there is but one Gospel, [and] there never was but one" and that this divine plan of salvation "is the same in every age of the world."[^1] In other words, Mormons view their faith as the re-establishment of the one true gospel that has existed from Adam through all the patriarchs and prophets—echoing perennialist ideas of a single sacred teaching handed down through history, now received in its fullness.

## Ancient Patriarchs Practiced the Same Religion

Central to LDS theology is the belief that earliest biblical figures—Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham—worshiped God with the same core principles, priesthood authority, and ordinances practiced today. Joseph Smith taught that God revealed to Adam "the plan of ordinances for the salvation of his posterity" and "set the ordinances to be the same forever and ever," charging Adam and his righteous descendants to pass down that true religion through the ages[^2].

Apostle John Taylor dramatized this continuity by portraying how Enoch, Jude, and Joseph Smith all "had the same Gospel" and spirit of revelation, enabling them to testify of identical truths across time[^3]. In Taylor's words: "I had just the same Gospel that Enoch had, and the same that Jude had; and I also testified of the same things, and we all agree."[^3] This underscored the Mormon view that the gospel taught by Joseph Smith was literally the same faith and power known to ancient prophets.

LDS scripture further traces an unbroken priesthood lineage: "Abraham received the priesthood from Melchizedek, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah…back to Enoch…and eventually to Adam."[^4] Mormons affirm that Abraham worshipped the same God and made the same covenants as today's church, inheriting the same authority in an unbroken line.

## "Fullness of the Gospel" Restored in the Last Days

Because this one true gospel was repeatedly given and then lost in periods of apostasy, Latter-day Saints see the modern church as the complete restoration of that ancient faith. A core tenet is that after the death of Christ's original apostles, the world fell into a Great Apostasy, abandoning many doctrines, ordinances, and priesthood keys. Joseph Smith's mission, Mormons assert, was to restore the fullness of God's gospel on earth once more during the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times[^5], gathering all former truth and authority in preparation for the Second Coming.

Elder Wilford Woodruff observed that "their revelations and prophecies all point to our day and that great kingdom of God" to come in the last days[^6], while President Brigham Young stated that "there never was a prophet, from Adam down… but who had his eye upon this great dispensation of the last days."[^7] Church presidents like Joseph Fielding Smith taught that "all the keys and powers of priesthood held by the prophets of former dispensations" must flow into this final era like clear streams flowing into a mighty river[^8]. Heavenly messengers are believed to have restored these keys to Joseph Smith, ensuring the modern church possesses all authority and ordinances that ever existed anciently.

## A Worldwide and Ongoing "Perennial" Truth

The Book of Mormon is itself presented as "Another Testament of Jesus Christ," containing the fullness of the gospel as taught by the resurrected Christ to people in the Western Hemisphere anciently."[^9] Its narrative affirms that Christ established his church among an Israelite-descended people in the Americas—complete with apostles, sacraments, and prophecy—demonstrating that God's true gospel has appeared throughout time and across civilizations.

Joseph Smith urged believers to "receive truth, let it come from whence it may," because all truth ultimately aligns with Christ's gospel[^10]. This inclusive stance mirrors perennial philosophy, yet Mormons assert that the fullness of that divine teaching is now uniquely restored in their church. The 2020 Bicentennial Proclamation reaffirms that Joseph Smith's First Vision and subsequent revelations inaugurated the "restitution of all things" (Acts 3:21), uniting ancient covenants and keys in this final dispensation[^11].
