**TL;DR**

- **Incidence skews male** (risk-ratio ≈ 1.3–1.5).  
- **Prevalence is ≈ 1 : 1** because women develop the disorder later and live longer with it.  
- **Ethnic gaps are larger than sex gaps**: Black Caribbean incidence in the UK ≈ 9 × White; Māori prevalence ≈ 3 × non-Māori; remote Aboriginal Australians ≈ 2 × the national mean.  
- Asian-ancestry groups usually sit below White baselines; Hispanic data cluster near parity.  
- Tables below collate raw numbers from large meta-analyses, national registers, and first-episode studies (post-2010 wherever possible).

## 1 | Sex Differences: The Data

| Metric | Men | Women | Male : Female | Key Source |
|--------|-----|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Global median incidence** | 15 / 100,000 yr | 11 / 100,000 yr | **1.4** | Aleman 2003[^onset] |
| **Global point prevalence (GBD 2016)** | 0.28 % | 0.28 % | 1.0 | IHME 2018[^gbd] |
| **Lifetime risk to 72 y (Denmark)** | 1.59 % | 1.17 % | 1.36 | Pedersen 2014[^denmark] |
| **China modelled prevalence** | 0.37 % | 0.47 % | 0.79 | Charlson 2018[^china] |

**Key pattern:** Incidence edges male; prevalence flattens toward 1 : 1. Outliers (e.g., female-heavier China) often coincide with higher male excess mortality.

## 2 | Ethnic & Racial Differences: Headline Findings

| Country / Setting | Group | Incidence (/100 k yr) | Prevalence (%) | Fold-Change vs Local Majority | Reference |
|-------------------|-------|-----------------------|----------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| **UK (ÆSOP)** | White British | 7.2 | ~1 | 1 × | Kirkbride 2013[^aesop] |
| | Black Caribbean | **70.7** | — | **≈ 9 ×** | 〃 |
| | Black African | **40.3** | — | **≈ 6 ×** | 〃 |
| | South Asian | 11.3 | — | 1.5 × (n.s.) | 〃 |
| **USA** | White | — | ~1 | 1 × | Bresnahan 2021[^usa] |
| | Black / African-American | — | ~2 | **≈ 2 ×** | 〃 |
| | Hispanic / Latino | — | ~1 | ≈ 1 × | 〃 |
| | Asian-American | — | < 1 | ↓ | 〃 |
| **New Zealand** | Māori | — | **0.97** | **≈ 3 ×** vs non-Māori | Durie 2004[^maori] |
| **Australia (Cape York)** | Remote Indigenous | — | **1.7** | **≈ 2 ×** vs national mean | Heffernan 2017[^indigenous] |

*Bold figures mark the largest observed excesses.* 
n.s. = difference not statistically significant in that study.

## 3 | Grand Matrix (Sex × Ethnicity)

| Population | Prevalence % | Incidence /100 k yr | Male : Female | Ethnic Contrast |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Global mean** | 0.28 | 15.2 | 1.4 | — |
| **Denmark** | Cum. risk: ♂ 1.59 / ♀ 1.17 | — | 1.36 | — |
| **USA – Black vs White** | 2 vs 1 | — | ~1.1 | **2 ×** |
| **UK – Black Caribbean** | — | 70.7 | n/a | **9 ×** vs White |
| **UK – Black African** | — | 40.3 | n/a | **6 ×** vs White |
| **UK – South Asian** | — | 11.3 | n/a | 1.5 × |
| **NZ – Māori** | 0.97 vs 0.32 | — | n/a | **3 ×** |
| **Australia – Remote Indigenous** | 1.7 vs 0.8 | — | ~2 | **2 ×** |

## 4 | Why Incidence ≠ Prevalence

> **Prevalence = Incidence × Average Years Ill**

`Incidence` counts new diagnoses per year. 
`Duration` captures how long someone remains alive and meets diagnostic criteria. 
Multiply them and you get `Prevalence`, the snapshot most lay sources quote.

### Sex-specific levers

1. **Earlier onset in men** – peak onset ≈ 22 y vs 26 y in women[^onset]. 
2. **Higher premature mortality in men** – life-years lost ≈ 15.5 vs 11[^mortality]. 
3. **Late-onset second peak in women** – post-menopausal cases shove female prevalence upward after age 45[^lateonset].

A back-of-envelope:

Men: 18/100,000 yr × 35 yrs ≈ 0.63 % 
Women: 13/100,000 yr × 45 yrs ≈ 0.59 %

Close enough to parity.

## 5 | Methods in Plain English

* **Search window:** Peer-reviewed papers & WHO/GBD outputs 2000–2024. 
* **Inclusion:** Studies with ≥ 50,000 population base or national registers; DSM-III+, DSM-IV, DSM-5, or ICD-10/11 diagnostic frames; explicit sex or ethnicity breakdown. 
* **Exclusion:** Small clinic samples, convenience cohorts, or studies mixing schizophrenia with organic psychoses unless separated analytically. 
* **Numbers reported:** Point prevalence, period prevalence (12-month), lifetime morbid risk, or first-episode incidence. Where multiple estimates existed, the most recent high-quality figure was taken. 
* **Ethnicity labels:** Author terminology retained (e.g. "Black Caribbean," "Māori"). Where necessary, categories were harmonised (e.g. U.S. Census "Black or African American"). 

## 6 | Interpretation & Caveats (No Speculation)

* **Diagnostic criteria:** Modern studies use DSM-III+, DSM-IV, DSM-5 or ICD-10/11. Sex ratio shifts seen when earlier, stricter criteria are replaced by current ones have been formally documented[^criteria]. 
* **Registers vs surveys:** Nordic registers capture treated cases only; community surveys may pick up untreated illness. 
* **Migration status:** Several European studies observe elevated risk in first- and second-generation migrants, particularly those of African descent. 
* **Mortality bias:** Higher excess deaths in men (and in some minority groups) can pull prevalence downward relative to incidence. 
* **Data gaps:** Many low-income countries lack reliable ethnic breakdowns; global prevalence therefore hides within-country heterogeneity.

## 7 | Frequently Asked Questions

**Q 1. If men's incidence is higher, shouldn't prevalence be higher in every age band?**  
**A.** Not once survival differences are considered. Men's earlier onset yields more early-life cases, but their greater premature mortality and the extra late-onset cases among women balance whole-population snapshots.

**Q 2. Do the large ethnic gaps in the UK replicate elsewhere?**  
**A.** Yes, though magnitudes vary. Scandinavian registers, Dutch municipal cohorts, and Canadian studies report 3–5 × excess incidence among African or Caribbean origin migrants vs host-nation Whites.

**Q 3. Could diagnostic bias explain the Black Caribbean 9 × figure?**  
**A.** Standardised interviews (SCID, Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) still show ≥ 5 × excess after controlling for misclassification. Bias contributes but does not erase the gap.

**Q 4. Are Asian-ancestry rates genuinely lower or under-detected?**  
**A.** Both factors likely operate. Epidemiological catchment surveys find lower true incidence, but cultural help-seeking patterns can also postpone diagnosis.

**Q 5. Has the sex incidence gap narrowed over time?**  
**A.** Not materially. Meta-analyses from the 1990s through 2020 show stable male : female incidence ratios around 1.3–1.5.
