**TL;DR**

- **Kunapipi / Gunabibi** is a Great Mother who **swallows boys and regurgitates them as men** during secret rites.  
- Her **Rainbow Serpent** totem (sometimes her own body) embodies blood, water, and rebirth.  
- The **bullroarer**’s drone is her “voice,” proving that the initiate’s soul has migrated.  
- **Yurlunggur** repeats the motif by gulping the Wawalag sisters, then vomiting them while gifting initiation songs.  
- Other myths—**Anjea’s spirit‑child pits** and the **pregnant boulder Erathipa**—show women/snake beings **storing or injecting souls** into humans.  
- Taken together, these stories encode a pan‑Australian theology of **digestive rebirth** that underwrites male initiation even while centering the Female Principle.

## 1 · Kunapipi, "Vagina of Country"

> *She came out of the sea trailing a rainbow snake, birthed spirit-children, ate the boys, then spat out adults.*[^1]

**Why the swallowing?** 
Digestive rebirth dramatizes liminality: the novice is *inside* the Mother/Snake (non-human), dissolved, then re-formed as fully socialised male. The rite is sealed by the **Kunapipi bullroarer**—a droning wooden slab whose sound is her intestinal rumble; only men may hear it.[^2]

| Element | Function in rite | Symbolic payload |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Swallowing | Removes old identity | Death / return to primordial waters |
| Digestion | Liminal "no-man's-land" | Soul-melting; taboo secrecy |
| Regurgitation | Bestows new skin | Re-birth, clan imprint, adult status |

### 1.1 · Rainbow Serpent Logic 
Blood, amniotic fluid, rain, river—**one hydrological metaphor**. A Rainbow Serpent is the *plasmic conduit* through which life flows, so having it gulp initiates is almost embarrassingly literal.

### 1.2 · Twin-Spirit Revelation 
When the bullroarer "sings," each initiate's **twin-spirit** (second, invisible self) is announced to the camp, fixing his social identity.[^3]

## 2 · Other Digestive Rebirth Myths

1. **Yurlunggur & the Wawalag Sisters** – Yolngu country  
   - Serpent swallows two sisters + infant, gags, vomits them thrice.  
   - Outcome: first **Djunggawul initiation liturgy**; the vomit is *song*.  
2. **Anjea** – Cape York  
   - Female being keeps disembodied **spirit‑children in sand pits** marked with twig crosses; later molds new infants from mud and inserts them into wombs.[^4]  
3. **Erathipa Boulder** – Central Desert  
   - A permanently pregnant rock full of foetal spirits waiting to **jump into passing women**; child‑shy women disguise themselves as elders to dodge impregnation.[^5]  

All three replicate Kunapipi’s logic: **storage → ingestion → release** of souls.
