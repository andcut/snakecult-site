**TL;DR**

- Five foundational "coming-out" stories—Diné, Zuni, Taíno, K'iche', Inka—are shot through with water-snakes and women.
- Serpents guard or rupture the under-world womb; female figures mend and people the surface world.
- The two motifs form a yin-yang of chaos-fertility (snake) and order-nurture (woman).
- Each myth embeds migration memories and political legitimation in that symbolic duet.
- Reading them side-by-side shows a pan-American grammar: birth happens when a snake-door opens inside a woman-world.

## Coiled Origins: Five Emergence Myths

Below the surface of the Americas, caverns, springs, and serpentine canals serve as natal chambers. When the seal breaks, humanity climbs out—usually under the tutelage of a mother-creator.

### 1 · Diné (Navajo) — The Four-World Ascent

"There was a world previous to this world… When the people became too many they climbed up through a reed … thus they came into the blue world… At last, through the reed, they emerged into the glittering white world in which we now dwell."[^1]

"It is in the fourth world that Changing Woman was born… She created the Diné from epidermal waste rubbed from her skin."[^2]

Tieholtsodi, a flood-spewing water monster, forces the ascent; Changing Woman immediately restores stability, turning shed skin into people.

### 2 · Shiwinna (Zuni Pueblo) — The Four Wombs

"Anon in the nethermost of the four cave-wombs of the world, the seed of men and the creatures took form … Then came among men … the all-sacred master Póshaiyaŋk'ya … winning issuance … out into the great breadth of daylight."[^3]

The journey is punctuated by Kolowisi, the horned water-serpent who both floods and fertilises; later, clan matrons parcel out social space.

### 3 · Taíno (Hispaniola) — Cacibajagua & Iguanaboina

"There is a mountain … that has two caves. … The majority of the people who populated the island came from Cacibajagua."[^4]

Sun and Moon themselves emerge from Iguanaboina—"Radiant Iguana / Dark Serpent."

Here the cave is the serpent-mother; her stone womb births celestial twins, then humankind.

### 4 · K'iche' Maya — Leaving Tulan Zuiva

"They began as enchanted people … when they came from Tulan Zuiva, the Seven Caves … They were pulled up like weeds as they came out from there, leaving the East behind."[^5]

"All alone are the Framer and the Shaper, Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent, They Who Have Borne Children…"[^6]

The plumed serpent is already gender-split and parental, fusing ophidian energy with maternal-paternal titles.

### 5 · Inka (Andes) — Viracocha's Call

"He [Viracocha] sculptured … all the nations that he intended to create. … At the sound of his voice people came forth, some from lakes, others from fountains, valleys, caves…"[^7]

After the watery exodus, sibling-spouses Mallku Cápac and Mama Ocllo found Cuzco; the royal epithet amaru ("shining serpent") lingers in names like Túpac Amaru.

## Spiral Logic: What Snakes & Women Do

| Function | Serpent Motif | Woman Motif |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Gateway / Womb | Cave-snake marks liminal breach (Iguanaboina; Tieholtsodi). | Body-womb or skin-womb births people (Changing Woman). |
| Fertility & Food | Vomits seeds, water, sun (Kolowisi; Taíno rainbow boa). | Invents maize, clans, law (Navajo; Maya; Inka). |
| Moral Reset | Flood or chaos that mandates migration. | Post-chaos order, civic founding. |
| Complementarity | Quetzal Serpent carries gender duality inside one being. | Foundress pairs with male co-ruler (Ocllo & Cápac). |

Bottom line: the serpent personifies the wet, interior, chaotic but life-bearing layer; the woman personifies the dry, exterior, ordering layer. Emergence is the splice point.

## FAQ

Q1. Why are water-snakes so common in American origin stories?
A. Continental myths map the dangerous abundance of floods and springs onto serpents; the snake's coiled body mirrors the labyrinthine caverns people imagined as Earth's womb.

Q2. Are the female figures always "mothers"?
A. Almost—whether as bio-mothers (Changing Woman), clan matrons (Zuni), or dynastic foundresses (Mama Ocllo), they anchor the social fabric that follows emergence.

Q3. Do any myths merge the two into one being?
A. Yes: the Popol Vuh's Quetzal Serpent carries explicit maternal and paternal epithets, compressing serpent energy and human parenthood into a single deity.
