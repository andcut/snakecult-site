**TL;DR**

- The *Enūma Eliš* opens with a cosmos that exists **without names**, hence without fixed roles.  
- Two verbs—*nabû* and *zakāru*—flag naming as a **performative speech-act** that finalizes reality.  
- Pre-naming chaos is not atheistic; deities (Apsû & Tiamat) already swim in it.  
- Once Marduk wins the divine war he assigns **fifty names**, locking the cosmic job chart.  
- Genesis 1 and Vedic hymns echo the same logic: creation = separation + naming.

## 2  Why Naming = Creation Tech

1. **Speech-acts** were legal instruments in Mesopotamia; uttering a formula enacted property transfers and curses.  
2. The gods receive **titles** (𒌓 *dUTU* “Sun-god,” 𒀭𒀀𒉡 *dAN* “Heaven-god”) that double as functional specs.  
3. Marduk’s post-war honour roll (“He shall be called …”) ties each of his fifty names to a domain—wind, medicine, justice—which priests could then invoke.

## 3 Cosmological Status Report

| Stage | State of matter | State of law |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Pre-naming | Watery mingle, no sky-earth split | No destinies, no jurisdictions |
| Separation | Tiamat split → sky roof / earth floor | Tablet of Destinies contested |
| Naming | Constellations, calendar, river-beds labelled | Divine bureaucracy activated |

Naming is the **final seal** after violent cosmogony and spatial separation.

## 4  Comparative Glances

| Text | Pre-cosmos line | First creative move |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Enūma Eliš* | "When on high the heaven had not been *named* …" | Marduk slays Tiamat → names everything |
| **Genesis 1** | "The earth was formless" | Elohim separates, then **calls** Day/Night |
| **Rig Veda 10.129** | "There was neither non-being nor being" | The gods **named** the quarters |
| **Hesiod, Theogony** | "Chaos was first" | Entities appear **already named**—Greek skips the suspense |

## 5  FAQ

**Q1. Does “no name” mean the gods didn’t exist yet?**  
**A.** No. Apsû and Tiamat are present but lack *defined roles*; absence of names blocks bureaucratic power, not existence.

**Q2. Is *nabû* always divine speech?**  
**A.** No—Akkadian contracts use the same verb; any authoritative naming (royal, legal, or divine) crystallises reality.

**Q3. Did Hebrews borrow the naming motif from Babylonia?**  
**A.** The parallel is strong, but scholarly opinion splits between direct borrowing during the Exile and convergent Near-Eastern narrative logic.
