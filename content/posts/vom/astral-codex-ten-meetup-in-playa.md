I will host the [Astral Codex Ten meetup](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/i/136380189/mexico) in [Playa del Carmen, Mexico](https://www.instagram.com/mexican.street.art/), on September 25th. Now, 33% of my readers already subscribe to ACX. The other two-thirds should carve out an hour, go to the park, and read [Meditations on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) pronto. 

Vectors of Mind is currently read in 68 different countries (!), so it's a bit of a long shot that you will be in town. However, readers have an open invitation to grab a drink if they are ever in the area. My friends and family need a reprieve from rare snake facts üêçüêçüêç

So as to not spam you with a separate September Subscriber Post, here are some links I wanted to share and a question for the group about the old European Goddess. Real post coming soon.

#### The Power of Myth


Joseph Campbell is known for the monomyth, but he also goes in for something close to a mono-ritual. In the Power of Myth series he [describes](https://youtu.be/hEqR73j_oMY?si=cFBkyC8X-6yQB_yt&t=1016) one version in Papua New Guinea. After days of ritual, a young woman is selected to induct each of that year's initiates into manhood. One by one, each young man enters a log cabin for his first (official) sexual experience. When the last boy is joined in rapturous embrace, the supports are withdrawn, the logs drop, and the couple is killed. As Campbell explains:

"The little pair are pulled out and roasted, and eaten right that evening, enacting the myth in its essential character. You can't beat that, and the truth; that's the sacrifice of the Mass."

The similarities, [he says](https://youtu.be/hEqR73j_oMY?si=59PGfZhr5aubaZVh&t=934), may be the result of diffusion. Highly recommend the whole series. If cannibalism isn't your thing, check out the Goddess:

#### [Early humans had to become more feminine before they could dominate the planet](https://theconversation.com/early-humans-had-to-become-more-feminine-before-they-could-dominate-the-planet-42952#)


The paper argues that humans have behaviorally and craniofacial feminized in the last 50,000 years. Nice fit for the Eve Theory of Consciousness (EToC)! The [reviews are public](https://sci-hub.se/10.1086/677209), and I want you to guess the first peer comment. Wait a moment and think. Okay, it's quoted below the plot.

_"In considering this model, I was struck by the possibility that perhaps both the biological and behavioral definitions of "feminization" used here are culturally embedded in Western notions of masculine/feminine and thus not necessarily good measures of social change."_

## **[The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe](https://www.amazon.com/Civilization-Goddess-World-Old-Europe/dp/0062508040)**


Speaking of good fits for EToC, there is Marija Gimbutas's theory of the Upper Paleolithic matriarchy. My understanding is that archeologists tend to consider it ideologically motivated, and it's fallen out of favor. In it, she mentions that only 3-5% (!) of Neolithic (~12kya to Bronze Age) sculpture is male. **Does anybody know of a more recent estimate?** Seems like the type of thing that should be updated since 1991 when she wrote the book. At any rate, it is remarkable that 10,000 years before the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test), women were the leading characters in mobile art.
