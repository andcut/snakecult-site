In this episode, I answer a few questions from a reader. Enjoy the show notes, which are helpful when discussing particular works of art.

### 1\. Who made Venus Figurines, men or women?


[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BEcq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3f2c568-ae8b-4d71-bed7-fe2ef2c53c5b_2560x1613.png)[Venus figurines of the Mal’ta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines_of_Mal%27ta), near lake Baikal, Russia. Dated 23 kya. 

  * Historical view (18th century): Men created these figurines as erotic objects.

  * Feminist reinterpretations (1970s): Proposed as mother goddess symbols created by women.

  * Shift in representation: 95% of human figures in art (40,000–10,000 years ago) depicted women.

  * Discussion on why modern art and even pornography typically feature more diverse representations, contrasting ancient trends.




### 2\. Why Would Men Steal Ritual Rites from Women?


  * Common historical pattern: Patriarchal societies absorbed or eliminated matriarchal secret societies.

  * Global myths: Examples include Taiwan myth (men’s rebellion against women).

  * Historical matriarchal elements persisted in traditions, e.g., witches, ancient beer recipes, Hopi women's snake antivenom.

  * Bachofen’s theory on predictable matriarchal-to-patriarchal transitions.

  * Did the Snake Cult Spread Patriarchally or Matriarchally?

    * Matriarchal origin myth (Djangawal Sisters, Northern Australia).

    * Patriarchal transformations documented in myths, e.g., shortening women's genitals

    * Baime the Sky Father in Eastern Australia




Below see the Great Goddess in North Australia, drawn at the time and place [Proto-Australian was first spoken](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111421889/html?lang=en&srsltid=AfmBOopVbfRZO-PSMnsjtSGnxaGGaSvcsi0PrZNvw70EA53_Mb2GF45q). According to some myths she arrived on a canoe and established law, language, and the initiations associated with Dreamtime myths.

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_bJq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff54b4e74-e34a-4150-bb74-c8311d974538_626x588.jpeg)

Compare this depiction to Baiame in Eastern Australia, where a sky father is worshipped. He is drawn in the same pose and [x-ray style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_style_art).

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VoPr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F617bc46f-78b9-4991-b8de-d6fd8b90fbf6_640x438.heic)[Traditional 19th Century recording of the Baiame cave painting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44058646_Digital_Recording_of_Aboriginal_Rock_Art/figures?lo=1)

Okay, one more. If you click the link to x-ray style art wiki uses this as the image par excellence:

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pLyl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd538f22f-e597-47bf-9856-0c0fa8c4acaf_1600x1200.heic)

This is a male Dreamtime figure, once again from the North. The similarities to Baiame are well established. However, in the East, the Sky Father dominates; there is no Great Goddess. Perhaps the snake cult was already male-dominated by the time it spread there. Or perhaps it spread as a matriarchy but the coup was more complete in some areas.

### 3\. How does that square with the central role of women at Eleusis?


  * Eve demoted from goddess but still called the "Mother of All Living," in a patriarchal polemic. In the mundane sphere, matrilineal descent for membership as a Jew.

  * [Bachofen’s analysis](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/i/145682170/myths-of-matriarchy-reconsidered-deborah-b-gewertz) of early Greek legal documents and cemeteries.




### 4\. Did Snake Venom Catalyze Mammalian Evolution?


  * Paper: "[Monkeying Around with Venom](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-021-01195-x)" demonstrates evolutionary adaptation to snake venom, notably in humans and great apes. [PBS Eons has a great explainer on YouTube](https://youtu.be/_zGy_tr_tY4?si=f73qOoGSMfquizkI).

  * Venom primarily led to physiological (paralysis resistance) adaptations rather than cognitive ones.

  * Other animals are not on the cusp of recursion.




### 5\. Is "I" a meme which serves as input/output of a separate, general recursive function or the function itself? If the former, when and how did it evolve?


  * "I" likely a subset, not the first instance, of recursive thought.

  * Snake cult possibly spread "I" concept globally around 15,000 years ago.

  * Evidence from myths coincides with symbolic thought and self-awareness emerging around 10,000 years ago (Genesis, Dreamtime, Nuwa & Fuxi myths).




### 6\. Personal Impact of Memetics on Spirituality


  * \- Initially agnostic/atheist, theory remains compatible with materialism.

  * \- Shifted toward idealism influenced by revisiting the New Testament, especially John’s Gospel.
