is a researcher and writer blogging about the science and politics of mental health at. In this episode, he joins me in dissecting the psychological and religious frameworks of Jordan Peterson, a figure we both consider to be the most influential psychologist of this century. The conversation probes Peterson's academic origins, his appeal among young men, the evolution of his religious views, and the broader cultural implications of his work. We end by discussing whether Peterson's prescriptions are enough for a meaningful life, and whether he provides us with the ammo to overcome nihilism. Ultimately, we come to see Peterson as an existentialist thinker who challenges his followers to overcome self-pity, despair, and depression through right action.
