If you haven't taken it, please check out the [Moments of Awakening survey](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/moments-of-awakening-survey). I'll post it on Reddit and X shortly to get a larger sample (please share with friends), but for now it doubles as a way to learn about VoM readers. For example, half of you have a graduate degree, and, after White, the most common ethnicity is Jewish (at 13%).

Short doc on the sapient paradox in the Americas, though it is never named. There were humans before Clovis culture 13,000 years ago, but in terms of culture they left not so much as a bead. No art, and only a few hints of stone tools so primitive some argue they are just fallen rocks or tools made by monkeys. EToC explains this.

> "And it's just: why don't we have this huge spread of tools for people 20,000 years ago? If they were in White Sands, if they made it to Brazil, why can't we find their tools? Why aren't their tools as common as this? I don't know. I don't know. Why—think about that. I mean, I think it's certainly possible that I was looking at the earliest Australian sites the other day, and a lot of these people seem to only really use, like, pretty—you know—their stone flakes that are clearly made by people, but, like, they're simple tools, right?"

### VoM in the wild:


The Snake Cult of Consciousness Two Years Later [on r/slatestarcodex](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1icx6jl/the_snake_cult_of_consciousness_two_years_later/). My framing: 

> Two years ago, Scott linked my essay that proposed the concept of "self" was discovered and diffused memetically via psychedelic ritual. This, I argue, led to a fundamental change in human psychology and is remembered in the world's creation myths. In this follow-up, I review some of those predictions. Is snake venom an entheogen? How widespread was its use? Did a mystery cult diffuse worldwide around the end of the Ice Age? Does anyone mainstream argue such a gene-culture interaction could explain the evolution of metacognition? (Yes)

[Michael Smith on X](https://x.com/Morphenius/status/1879270868918157798) discusses the evolution of the ego (and what to do about it). 

> "I'm guessing THE absolute super duper huge advantage humans got over the rest of the biosphere is mental time travel. We learned how to structure our relationship to time so that we could make arbitrary plans & coordinate w/ each other about them. All else is footnotes."

The people on X were NOT having my claim that women were human first.

#### Moments of awakening


As he is wont, Scott does a good job summarizing a bunch of text from around the internet, this time about people's first memories:

One of the top comments: "I gained conciousness while staring at a mosaic tapestry my teacher had hung on the wall and just started to quietly spiral while staring at it for the rest of class, fun times" May I introduce you to how they did it in the Paleolithic?
