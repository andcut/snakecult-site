In this episode I speak with , an Australian psychologist and writer of the [Mind & Mythos](https://mindandmythos.substack.com) Substack. Dan's work explores the intersection of psychology, mythology, and narrative, initially focusing on traditional psychological topics like personality theory and psychopathology before expanding into broader cultural and literary analysis. Our wide-ranging discussion delved into theories of consciousness, personality, mental illness, and the enduring power of religious and mythological narratives.

The conversation weaved through several key themes around how humans construct meaning and identity. We discussed the DSM's limitations in categorizing mental illness, cybernetic theories of personality, and how the self-memory system helps create coherent personal narratives. This led to deeper explorations of how myths and religious stories may contain essential truths about human psychological development and social organization. Dan offered thoughtful perspectives on Christianity's role as arguably history's most successful narrative framework, while acknowledging the inherent challenges of bureaucratization in religious institutions. The discussion concluded with reflections on early psychological development and the potential risks of children lacking meaningful mythological frameworks in the modern digital age.
