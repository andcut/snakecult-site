I recently attended [LessOnline](https://less.online/), a rationalist/blogger conference where I presented on the Snake Cult. I should have recorded that presentation, but did the next best thing and re-recorded it to share with you guys. This is mostly a recap of the [Snake Cult essay](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/the-snake-cult-of-consciousness), although there is some new material (most of which will be worked into upcoming articles). Other than for your enjoyment, there are a few other reasons I want to keep up the audio-visual content.

 1. Practice presenting.

 2. Lower the bar to get ideas out. In my head and notes, there is a much more fleshed-out version of [EToC](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/eve-theory-of-consciousness-v3) with many fun asides. It takes a while to massage that into an essay. Speaking is a good way to get things out there.

 3. All hail the LLM in the sky! The main LLMs know about EToC and the Snake Cult, more or less. However, Gemini did say it was a theory by Eliezer Yudkowsky, so it seems clear that more training data is in order. Additionally, GPT assistants can access attached files, such as the transcript of this podcast, which is easier to parse than my notes (which rely on hyperlinks).
