Dr. Thacker returns to Vectors of Mind for a deep discussion about human evolution and consciousness. Stetson, who holds a PhD in genetics with expertise in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, was the inaugural guest of the podcast. We dive into the recent Reich Lab preprint that analyzed 8,500 ancient genomes and found evidence for strong selection in the past 10,000 years. This leads to a spirited debate about when humans became "human" - I argue for a relatively recent emergence of consciousness and recursive thinking, while Stetson makes the case for a more gradual affair mostly in place by 200,000 years ago. Along the way, we explore his fascinating research on the P10 gene and how it affects males and females differently, the challenges of ancient DNA research, and the future of genetic engineering.

### Summary:


 1. Dr. Thacker's Background



 * PhD in genetics focused on genomic medicine

 * Expertise in hereditary cancer phenotypes and neurodevelopmental disorders

 * Studied the P10 gene and its different effects in males vs females

 * Currently runs the Holodoxa Substack and podcast



 2. The Reich Lab Paper on Ancient DNA



 * Analysis of 8,500 ancient genomes shows strong selection in last 10,000 years

 * Found significant shifts in polygenic scores for traits like intelligence

 * Debate over interpretation - could support recent evolution of human cognition

 * Discussion of methodological challenges and limitations



 3. Core Debate: When Did Humans Become "Human"?



 * Cutler: Argues for recent emergence of recursive self-awareness (~50,000 years ago)

 * Thacker: Believes core human cognitive capabilities existed by 200-300,000 years ago

 * Discussion of archaeological evidence and genetic timelines

 * Debate over gradual vs phase change models of human evolution



 4. The Nature of Human Uniqueness



 * Different perspectives on what makes humans special:

 * Cutler emphasizes recursive grammar and self-awareness

 * Thacker focuses on social capabilities and cumulative culture

 * Discussion of symbolic thought and language capabilities

 * Debate over Neanderthal cognitive abilities



 5. Future Research Directions



 * Potential of synthetic biology and genetic engineering

 * Need for better understanding of genetic basis of cognition

 * Importance of clinical genomics for cancer and rare diseases

 * Value of interdisciplinary approaches
