Data scientist [Matthew Fisher](https://twitter.com/MathYouF) and I met at the Less Online conference at Lighthaven in Berkeley, where I gave a [presentation](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/snake-cult-lessonline-presentation) on the Snake Cult of Consciousness. Between sessions, we discovered we had both been deep in the literature at the intersection of machine learning and personality psychology. In fact, he brought up some of my PhD research before knowing I was the author! Mark one for the annals of felicitous moments while haunting the halls of the rationalists.

Now we’re organizing the [Love Symposium](https://symposium.love) at the same location. Like Less Online, we expect to attract curious, open-minded people interested in novel approaches to old problems. The focus will be on using AI and personality science to address the problem of matching compatible people, particularly for long-term partnership.

If you're in the Bay Area November 15-17, come join us at Lighthaven. The main events will be during these dates, with more informal discussions happening in the days before. I'll personally be in SF November 11-25, so reach out if you'd like to meet up or if there’s someone you think I should connect with while I’m there.
