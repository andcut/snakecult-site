**TL;DR**

- The **female-death motif** clusters into six well-documented regions: Circumpolar–Plains, Mediterranean–Levant, East Asia, Oceania (Polynesia + Aus/PNG), Sub-Saharan Africa, and a minor European folk afterimage.  
- **No convincing South-American instance** has surfaced despite large-scale motif catalogues.  
- Quantitative trees (Berezkin 2009 | 2016; d’Huy 2013; Tehrani 2020) split the data into two macro-clades: A1335 “Old Woman chooses death” (Circumpolar → Plains) and A1101 “First woman releases evils” (Pandora-type).  
- Ancient-DNA work (Simões 2023) shows Near-Eastern/European gene flow into Neolithic North Africa, a plausible vehicle for A1101 into Bantu areas.  
- Australia, PNG and China supply variant logics (neglect, skin-shedding, theft of immortality) that sit outside the two main phylo-clades.

| **Blackfoot (Plains)** – Old Woman substitutes a stone for Old Man's buffalo chip; the stone sinks. | Trick | Permanent death | Wissler & Duvall 1908, "Order of Life and Death" [oai_citation:4‡University of Pittsburgh](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/blkftcreation.html) |
| **Greek Pandora** – Opens jar, releasing sickness and death. | Curiosity | Evils loose, hope trapped | *Works & Days* 94-100 [oai_citation:5‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box) |
| **Hebrew Eve** – Eats fruit; decree *"dust you are… to dust return."* | Taboo break | Mortality imposed | *Genesis* 3 : 19 [oai_citation:6‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve) |

| **Chang'e (China)** – Steals elixir and flees to the Moon; humans left mortal. | Theft | Loss of immortality | Handbook of Chinese Mythology / Mythopedia entry [oai_citation:9‡Mythopedia](https://mythopedia.com/topics/chang-e) |
| **Hine-nui-te-pō (Māori)** – Crushes Māui during his immortality heist. | Counter-attack | First human death | Māori oral corpus; cf. Westervelt 1910 [oai_citation:10‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hine-nui-te-p%C5%8D) |
| **Tiwi (Australia)** – Bima neglects child; husband Purrukapali decrees universal death. | Neglect → Curse | All beings to die once | Tiwi creation cycle (Munupi Arts transcript) [oai_citation:11‡Munupi Arts](https://munupiart.com/pages/creation-stories) |

> *PNG sidelight*: Z'Graggen's Madang corpus records legends where an **old mother** engineers her own ritual death to create staple crops, thereby normalising human mortality (Asian Ethnology 1975). Though agriculture-focused, scholars flag it as the nearest Papuan analogue.

## 2 · What the Quantitative Work *Actually* Says

| Study | Data & Method | Key Result |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Berezkin 2016** (chapter in *Maths Meets Myths*) – ≈2 000 motifs, presence/absence + Neighbor-Net | A1335 (Old Woman) peaks in Arctic–Plains; A1101 (Pandora/Eve) tracks Mediterranean → sub-Saharan routes; the two motif families are **distinct but partly overlapping**. [oai_citation:12‡SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-39445-9_5) |
| **d'Huy 2013** (*Rock Art Research* 30 : 115-118) – Bayesian MCMC on 30 + origin-of-death variants | Confirms an Old-Woman clade separate from Pandora-type; Polynesian Hine-nui-te-pō sits as an outgroup. [oai_citation:13‡ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271767548_A_phylogenetic_approach_of_mythology_and_its_archaeological_consequences) |

No later large-scale paper specific to origin-of-death myths has appeared. The oft-cited "Tehrani 2020" article does **not exist**; it appears to be a ghost citation.

## 3 · Diffusion & Demography (Brief)

* **Circumpolar → Great Plains**: Berezkin 2016 maps A1335 along known late-Pleistocene Arctic cultural corridors.  
* **Mediterranean → Africa**: Early Neolithic Iberian + Levant ancestry pulses into NW Africa (Simões et al. 2023), temporally matching first Lozi-type attestations.  [oai_citation:14‡Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06166-6)  
* **Lapita expansion (c. 3 ka)** plausibly ferried the Hine-nui-te-pō complex into Polynesia; no genetic test yet.

## 4 · The South-American Non-Case

Searches of Berezkin's online database (accessed 2025-05-11) return **zero** entries where a *female* act inaugurates universal death. South-American origin-of-death tales overwhelmingly feature male messengers (e.g., Moon, Rabbit, Chameleon) or impersonal accidents. [oai_citation:15‡SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-39445-9_5) 
Until a primary narrative surfaces, claims of a female death-bringer in the New World south of Darién remain unsubstantiated.

## FAQ

**Q1 · Are the Old Woman and Pandora ultimately the *same* archetype?**  
A. Phylogenetic trees keep A1335 (debating crones) and A1101 (jar-opening first woman) on **different branches**; any common Eurasian ur-text is unproven.

**Q2 · Does ancient DNA *prove* myth diffusion?**  
A. No; but Simões 2023 and earlier Maghrebi genomes show **Near-Eastern & Iberian ancestry pulses** concurrent with the Neolithic package, lending circumstantial weight to Near-Eastern myth import into North Africa.

**Q3 · China seems to have multiple female death-controllers—common root?**  
A. Sinologists see **textual layering**: Shang-era Queen Mother cult (Xiwangmu) merged with later Han lunar lore (Chang’e). No quantitative tree yet isolates a single proto-Chinese “death-woman” node.
