By the time Jesus came around, the the gods were silent. All that was left was The Law.

Jesus begins his ministry by saying “I am That Being”. I may translate this to “I am that collective conscience that spoke to the prophets, and to us all in eden”. They had a special understanding of that voice that had allowed them to thrive in a multicultural world. They were chosen by virtue of knowing the nature of God. How had they reduced that to a series of rules?

**13** “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

**14** “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.

**17** “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

**21** “You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ **22** But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.

**23** “Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, **24** leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.

[Your inner voice should not even know hate. Knowing Mormons, I believe this is possible.]

**14** For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. **15** But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

“Do not judge, or you too will be judged. **2** For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

[very good advice. Our model of society is influenced by our own demands. If we do not forgive others it is hard for us to conceive them forgiving us.]

**25** “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? **26** Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? **27** Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

[good reminder not to ruminate. sermon quite a good way to deal with conscience]

So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

[This also sums up the voice. We model what others want, and this is our conscience. When we are more forgiving, we believe others can be as well. Hence our conscience is assuaged. We cannot demand punishment for others without heightening that own trait in our inner voice.]

**21** “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.**22** Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ **23** Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’

**28** When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, **29** because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.

reiterating that there are many voices and it is our job to discern which one is god. 

“Still, in the vision of Isaiah, God calls the servant, Israel, to be “a light to the nations” that his salvation may reach to the ends of the earth (Is 49:6). This speaks of Israel as a mentor for spiritual and moral guidance for the entire world in virtue of its being the Chosen People. In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus calls his disciples the salt of the earth and the light of the world, giving them a role similar to Israel’s vis-à-vis the other nations.” https://mb.com.ph/2022/06/07/you-are-the-salt-of-the-earth-the-light-of-the-world/
