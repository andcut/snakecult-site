  1. It’s fine to point out there are mysteries, but AAA functions as gods of the gaps.

  2. Atlanteans

    1. https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/The_Epic_of_Humanity.html?id=4QSSzwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y

      1. In some way, I blame the anthropologists, who gave up asking who we are and where we came from. The void will be filled! Just answer a simple question: why are bull-roarers so widespread?

      2. Innana/Tiamat is a really good fit for EToC!

    2. Younger Dryas destruction: Atlanteans teach civilization anew

      1. Comprehensive refutation of the YDIH: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825223001915

      2. What about the garbage? He says they were too evolved for plastics. Okay, what about shit? Arrowheads? Domesticated plants/animals? Why do we have evidence for only the boring civilizations?

        1. One answer is the rising sea.

      3. Where is the genetic bottleneck 11kya?

        1. In reality, we see population expansion

      4. Or what about Atlanteans entering the rest of the human population? They should be linked to EHG, ANE, etc.

    3. Inventing continents

      1. Atlantic Ridge

        1. claims fossils of shallow-water animals. Exactly the type of debate you would want to see. (would not effect EToC, btw)

      2. Lemuria

        1. Rejected by hancock: https://omtimes.com/2014/09/graham-hancock/

        2. Though he does support it on his website: https://grahamhancock.com/nervigc1/?fbclid=IwAR2Y7OVH4kAIkXL02PqZ2bjNhSpOdPgPKUdM4EppFcQwDVotuyFE0c2aTuc

      3. Green Antarctic

        1. It involves rejecting plate tectonics and ice cores. GH still advocates for this!

  3. Aliens (Maybe split into two?)

    1. Not strictly-speaking against aliens. (GMU crowd also bullish on Aliens.) But IMO at least the question of how we became human can be completely answered by genetics, cultural diffusion, etc. Even if there are problems where the fields currently ignore those possibilities.

    2. Bull-roarer package connected at least for Bethe. Why couldn’t it have diffused with dogs? Did the Aliens also introduce dogs then? And they made special care that they were genetically drawn from Siberia. And then timed it to look like their introduction followed a phylogeny.

    3. Cyclopean masonry is fantastically similar. Not explained. Fine to have aliens on the table, but really uncertainty should be emphasized. Instead, it’s usually aliens + energy grids + join my course where I teach you how to see auras and manifest a million dollars. Maybe! But it sure adds a lot of baggage to the original question.

  4. Conclusion. Science is a strong-link problem. Fine to have bad ideas. And really valuable to point out mysteries. But this crowd doesn’t do a good job of seriously engaging with many streams of evidence. 

    1. Further, when do these people think language evolved? When did we first realize that we were agents and that we would die? Why are bull-roarers so often used in male initiation? Why are there seven sisters?

      1. On the last point, tons of speculation that it was Aliens from the Pleiades or Sirius. But why can’t it be a mnemonic device for an important story?

OP’s description: “Matthew Lacroix is a researcher who has looked deep into sumerian records to compile this timeline.”

“I for one would have benefited more from space on the timeline representing a consistent amount of time than having BCE explained. How did the Romans destroy the Library of Alexandria in 3,000BCE?”

The Epic of Humanity will take you on an incredible journey into our mysterious past, uncovering the secrets of our origins, influences of the Anunnaki, and the rise and fall of grand civilizations that disappeared long ago. Contained within cuneiform tablets, papyrus, and cylinder scrolls, this forgotten history has been spoken about by countless ancient civilizations, who left behind the keys to unlocking higher consciousness, immortality, and the path into the Golden Age of Aquarius. From highly sophisticated megalithic temples and pyramids, to sacred libraries, sunken cities, and ancient catastrophes, the story of humanity is truly one of the greatest epics ever told.This book includes:·The largest collection of ancient texts ever contained in a single book that includes: Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Egyptian, Gnostic, Greek, and more.· The 200,000-year timeline of humanity, from the rise of civilization.· New archaeological discoveries, ice-core data, and compelling-scientific evidence to prove lost civilizations once existed.· Detailed analysis of the Anunnaki and their role in human-Earth history.· The future of humanity and transition into the Age of Aquarius.
