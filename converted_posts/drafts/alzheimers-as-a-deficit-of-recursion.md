Embryology, the comparison of embryos of different species, predates Darwin’s _Origin of Species_. In it he says "_Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals._ "

This idea is reflected in the pithy phrase _phylogeny recapitulates ontology_. That is the development of an individual animal (ontology) follows the evolutionary path of that species (phylogeny). Originally this leaned very hard into higher and lower forms of life, where human embryos would go through the stages of thee lower forms. This version is [not popular today](https://evolutionnews.org/2021/10/so-does-ontogeny-recapitulate-phylogeny-nope/). However, I first heard the claim from a psychometrician who treated it less like a law and more like a heuristic.

I wonder if it applies in reverse to aging: s _enescence capitulates to phylogeny_. That is, in aging our most recently evolved traits deteriorate first. 

(Epistemic status: highly speculative. Fun idea.)

## Swallowing


Once we evolved language, there was selective pressure on the function of our throat to be able to produce a wide range of sounds to the detriment of other functions, such as swallowing food[^1]. This means we have more complicated swallowing mechanics than other animals, and a higher risk of choking while eating food. And the selection pressure was after language became important for our survival, so likely fairly recently. The textbook answer is that we evolved full language ~100,000 years ago. But likely even partial language could be fit to master and exert pressure on sound functions. Alzheimer’s produces lots of problems, but one particular pain point is swallowing[^2].

## Language


[it seems that it’s not true that semantic memory requires recursion. This whole idea seems dead in the water. Writing is good like that. Forces you to defend ideas preceisely. https://theconversation.com/what-types-of-memories-are-forgotten-in-alzheimers-disease-164014#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20show%20that%20in,decline%20in%20their%20general%20knowledge. ]

Of course, there is the language itself. Animals produce different calls that refer to different predators, which is pretty close to having “words”. However, their communication doesn’t have a whole semantic network of related meanings. This is unique to human language, and must have evolved later.

In the past, I worked at a company predicting Alzheimer’s progression from various tests. Some of the best tests are quite simple, like asking someone to name as many animals as they can in 60 seconds. Cognitively, this is quite a different task than asking someone to name as many words that start with the letter “L”. The former requires traversing semantic networks, a category. The latter requires a phonetic lookup, which doesn’t have to do with meaning.

Interestingly, some people with Alzheimer’s can rattle off words that start with “L”. They produce lists that would be physically impossible for you and I, because each adjacent word is semantically unrelated. If you produce the word “live” then your next two words are likely to be “laugh” or “love”. Not so with someone without a semantic network!

As such, one of the best indicators of Alzheimer’s disease is the difference in performance on these two exams. It’s almost like your phonetic memory can be used to baseline what your semantic memory should be.
