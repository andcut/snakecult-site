**1\. The Primordial Parents of the World and the Primitive Amazon Myth**

In the beginning, people did not live on the surface of the earth. There was only one man and one woman, and they lived under the earth. These two people were the first and only ones, and they didn’t know that there was a different gender for everyone. One day, they were at a spring and wanted to drink water. The man said, "Let me drink first." The woman said, "No, I will take water first, I am the first." The man wanted to push the woman aside. The woman hit him. Both hit each other. The man hit the woman so that she fell. Her clothes tore on the side. Her legs were naked.

The man saw the woman lying naked before him. He saw that she was different from him. He saw that she had a "tachschunt" (i.e., a girl’s vagina, the woman’s vagina is called "atchchun"). He felt that he had a "thäbuscht" (the penis of young men, the penis of older men is called "äbusch"). He looked at the "tachschunt" and said, "What is this?" He stuck his finger in, and the woman said, "That is good." The man felt his "thäbuscht" grow. He decided to lie with the woman. He lay with the woman. He did this every day and night.

After nine months, the woman gave birth to a daughter. Again after nine months, the woman gave birth to another daughter. Again after nine months, the woman gave birth to another daughter. And so it went on, until the man and the woman together had fifty daughters and fifty sons. The father and the mother stayed with the children and began calling themselves parents. The parents taught their children everything.

The fifty girls went together to the north. The fifty boys went together to the east. After a few years, they came to the surface of the earth and saw the sun. The girls saw the sun as a light. It was the first time they saw the sun. The girls looked at the sky, and the boys looked at the sky. The boys wanted to stay on the earth, but they could not. The girls wanted to stay on the earth, but they could not. The boys shouted to the sky and said, "What should Why should we stay under the earth when there is a place from which one can see the sky?" The boys then climbed up through their hole to the surface of the earth.

The fifty girls now set out on their way over the earth, and the fifty boys set out on their way over the earth. They knew nothing of each other.

At that time, all trees and herbs and stones still spoke. The fifty girls saw the herbs and asked them, "Who created you?" The herbs said, "The earth brought us forth." The girls asked the earth, "Who made you?" The earth said, "I am as I have always been." That night, the girls saw the moon and the stars and shouted, "Who made you, who stands high above us and all the trees? Are you the one who gives us light? Are you the one who has made the small and the big stars? Or is there something that has made everything?" All the girls shouted together. But the moon and the stars were so high; they could not answer. All fifty girls shouted and cried.

The boys were on their journey to a region where they came so close to the place of the fifty girls that they heard the girls' cries from a distance. They called to each other, "We will search in another direction, we will not find out who made us by looking at the sky." The fifty boys then turned around and set off. They moved in the direction where they heard the cries of the girls.

When they had gone a while, they came to a big river. The river lay between the fifty girls and the fifty boys. The boys called to the girls, but the girls' cries were drowned out by the noise of the river. The boys heard the girls' cries from the distance and followed the river's course. The boys reached the other bank and stood still. Then they saw the fifty girls standing and crying. The boys called to them, "We are also human. We are boys." The girls called back, "We are girls, and we are looking for who made us and all things." The boys said, "We are doing the same."

The fifty boys asked the river, "You are not like us, we cannot walk over you and cannot touch you as we can walk over the earth. What are you? How can one get across you to the other side?" The river said, "I am the water. I am here to bathe and wash. I am here to drink. If you want to come over to my other side, go up where I am narrow, and you will get across."

The fifty boys went along the river and saw the spot where it was narrow. They crossed to the other side of the river.

The fifty boys now wanted to go to the fifty girls. The fifty girls said, "Do not come too close. We are suffering. Do not come over here. We will stay here (i.e., at a certain distance). These steps will keep us apart." The fifty girls and the fifty boys now walked beside each other at a certain distance. But they did not come together.

On their way, the fifty boys came to a spring one day. The fifty girls also came to the spring. The boys said, "Didn’t the river tell you that water is for bathing? Come, we want to bathe." The fifty boys began to take off their clothes and to go into the water. The fifty girls saw the spring and saw that it was the boys who were there. One brave girl said, "Come with me, we want to see what the other people do." Two or three girls said, "We will come with you." All the others said, "No, we will not go."

The three girls sneaked through the bushes to the boys. But the boys did not stay back. They came up to the brave girl. The brave girl came very close to the boys under the protection of the bushes. The girl went through the bushes to the boys and took off her clothes and bathed with the boys. The girl saw the boys naked. The girl saw how different they were made. The girl bathed with them. The boys saw that the girl had no penis. The girl saw that the boys had no breasts. The girl called to the other girls, "Come, we want to see what the other people do." The other girls did not come. But the brave girl stayed and played with the boys. The fifty boys now went down into the water, and the brave girl said, "People should see and understand. Where we have breasts, they have nothing. Where we have the 'tachschunt', they have something different. On the head, they do not have long hair like us, but short hair. When you see them naked, the heart beats, and one wants to embrace them. If you have seen them naked, you can never forget it." The other girls said, "You lie." The brave girl said, "Go yourselves and see how I have changed." The other girls said, "We will move on."

The fifty girls continued on their way. The fifty boys continued on their way. The boys walked slowly further. The girls, however, walked faster and faster, making a curve and thus coming into the boys' path. They camped very close to each other.

On the day when the fifty boys camped very close to the fifty girls, the boys said, "We do not want to sleep in the open under the sky anymore. We want to build houses." Some boys began to make holes in the earth. They dug in the holes in the earth. Others made corridors and chambers under the earth and fell asleep there. Some boys said, "What are you doing? Building houses in the earth? Is there nothing here but stones that one can stack on top of each other?"

These boys piled stones on top of each other. They left a gap in the walls to go in and out. When they had built walls, one of the boys brought a tree and began to build a roof. The tree said, "What, you want to cut me down? What are you doing? Are you older than I am? If you want to cut me down, I will knock you over." The boy said, "I am not older than you. But I want to cut you down. I want to build fifty houses and knock down fifty trees. And if you do not want to fall, I will break your arms." The boy took an axe and began to cut the tree. The tree said, "That hurts." The boy cut down fifty trees. The branches of the trees hung into the houses and covered the roofs. The boy was glad when he had cut down the tree and covered the roof. The boy made the house so beautiful that he liked it.

Among the girls, there was also a wild one (theebill). This wild boy did not want to live in a house. He built himself a house like the others, but then snuck between the houses at night to catch someone and eat them. For he was so wild, when he thought about it, he just wanted to kill and eat others.

At some distance, the fifty girls camped. The girls saw from afar how the fifty boys first dug holes and corridors. They then saw the fifty boys building their houses. The fifty girls said among themselves, "What are the other people doing? What are they doing with the stones? What are they doing with the trees?" The brave girl said, "I will go back. I will sneak back in and see what the other people are doing. I have seen them naked once and want to see them again."

The brave girl snuck through the bushes to the boys' houses. The girl came very close to the houses. The girl snuck into one of the houses. No one was in there. The girl saw how beautiful the house was. The girl saw the wild boy (theebill) walking by outside the house. He saw the girl. The girl was startled and screamed. The girl ran out of the house and as quickly as she could in the direction of the camp where the girls were staying.

All the boys heard the girl’s scream. All the boys ran and surrounded the girl. The girl screamed. The other girls heard the scream and ran to the bushes. The other girls ran into the bushes and came face to face with the boys. In the bushes, the fifty boys and the fifty girls met. The boys and the girls touched. The boys touched the girls. The girls also touched the boys. They met.

It was the first time they had come so close together. The fifty boys and the fifty girls walked together. The fifty girls ran to the boys. The fifty girls met the boys. The fifty boys met the girls. They stayed together. They met and saw each other.

The fifty boys threw the wild boy out of the camp. The fifty boys threw the wild boy into the river. The fifty boys saw the wild boy drowning in the water. The brave girl said, "Now I will go again, as the brave girl did before."

(thebili), as well as among the girls there was a wild one (thebili). This wild boy did not want to build a house like the others, but constantly sneaked between the houses of the others and sought to catch and devour someone. For he was so wild that he wanted to kill and eat the others.

At some distance camped the fifty girls. The girls saw from afar how the fifty boys dug themselves holes and caves. They saw then how the fifty boys built their houses. The fifty girls said to each other: "What are the other people doing? What are they making with the stones? What are they doing with the trees?" The bold girl said: "I will go there again. I will sneak closer again and see what the other people are doing. I have seen them once before and want to see them again."

The bold girl crept through the bushes towards the houses of the boys. The girl came quite close to the houses. The girl slipped into one house. There was no one inside. The girl looked around in the house. Outside came just the Wild One (thebili) past. He smelled the girl. He roared. The girl was frightened and screamed. The girl ran out of the house and as fast as she could, she ran away, in the direction to the place where the girls camped.

All boys had heard the girl's scream. All boys jumped up and ran after the girl. The girl ran through the bush and screamed. The other girls heard the screaming. The girls jumped up and ran towards the screaming girl. The girls ran to meet the girl to help her. In the bush, the fifty girls and the fifty boys encountered each other. Each time a girl and a boy bumped into each other. The girls and boys hit each other. It was always one who bumped into each other, a girl and a boy. Also the wild girl and the wild boy met each other.

It was in the bush, and they could not see each other. It was always only that a girl and a boy, the wild girl and the wild boy had met each other. The fifty girls were very strong. The fifty girls threw down the fifty boys. The fifty girls lay on top of the boys. The fifty girls said to themselves: "Now I want to see if the Bold One was right or not." The girls grabbed the boys between the thighs. They found the Thåbuscht in the boys. When they touched it, the Thåbuscht of the boys became hard, and the boys lay completely still. As the girls touched the Thåbuscht of the boys, their hearts beat faster. The fifty girls took off their own clothes and pushed their Thåbuscht into the Tåtschunt. The boys lay quite still. The fifty girls slept with the fifty boys. The fifty boys then became very wild.

Each boy took a girl and went with her to his house. They married each other. In the house, the boys said: "It is not right that the woman lies on the man. We want in the future the Thåbuscht to penetrate, that we men lie on the women. So we will be the masters." In the future, they lay together in this way, as the men and women of the Kabyls do today*.

Afterwards, the fifty girls and fifty boys were very satisfied with each other. Only the Wild One and the Wild One, who had no house, moved between them and sought each other in different ways. The others heard them everywhere in their vicinity, and when they met, they mated with each other. The Wild One and the Wild One said to each other: "Are we not different from these people? Why do they always mistreat us? Isn't it better if we go away from them? Shall we not go together into the bush (i.e., the forest)?" The Wild One and the Wild One made their way into the bush. They went into the forest. In the future, they came out of the forest and stole children that they ate. The Wild One became the first Teriel, the Wild One became the first Lewe. Both nourished themselves from humans they ate.

The other women and men were happy that they were freed from the man-eaters. They lived very happily with each other. Their food consisted only of herbs that they picked.

*From this myth, the old Kabyls curiously explained their oldest and religiously revered, first strictly regulated form of the first marital intercourse, whose position (exactly like that of the ancient Egyptians) they called Asthenie and Guigutmutirth
