Outside of this blog, it’s actually fairly mainstream to say snakes have influenced human evolution. Many are familiar with the  [Snake Detection Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_detection_theory), which suggests the human ability to rapidly detect and respond to snakes evolved because they were a primary predator of primates. In this post, I’d like to discuss the evidence for chemical defenses as well following the recent paper: [Monkeying around with venom: an increased resistance to α-neurotoxins supports an evolutionary arms race between Afro-Asian primates and sympatric cobras](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-021-01195-x).# An Ancient Arms Race[Around 37 million years ago](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150277), snakes evolved a potent new venom that fundamentally disrupted neuromuscular signaling, paralyzing prey and halting their breathing. This innovation targeted the cholinergic system—a network of receptors and signaling molecules (especially the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) central to everything from muscle contraction to memory formation. Over millions of years, primates, including our ancestors, evolved countermeasures against these toxins, shaping one of the longest-running and most impactful arms races in evolutionary history.Interestingly, Gorillas, Chimps, and Humans are the primates with the best defenses, indicating that our last common ancestor (8-10 million years ago), must have been particularly prone to fighting snakes[^1]. For example, Fig 1A shows Homininae as the darkest blue (least susceptible to snake venom).

Snakes cause changes in multiple branches of family trees. Case study of the caecelians. 

This is cool because it’s analogous (on much different time scales) to what I suppose could happen with a gene-culture interaction. Something like grammar or metacognition spreads, and then you could get completely separate populations being selected for the same phenotype (even if the genetic implementation is different). 

Conclusion: My theory is quite different. I think the changes have been fundamental to meta-cognition, and enacted over tens of thousands instead of millions of years. But the idea that snakes have changed our choline system (which is implicated in schizophrenia) is an extremely mainstream idea. Maybe our resistance over millions of years allowed us to invent the snake cult to begin with. Homininae are the honey badgers of the primates.

## Snake Detection TheoryThe Snake Detection Theory suggests the human ability to rapidly detect and respond to snakes evolved because they were a primary predator of, well, primates. Humans and other primates show heightened vigilance and faster reaction times when detecting snakes compared to other potentially dangerous stimuli, like spiders or predatory mammals. Even young children and individuals with limited exposure to snakes often exhibit a fear or heightened awareness of snake-like shapes and patterns.

This theory claims to explain the ubiquity of snakes in mythology. However, this also implies snake myths should not form a phylogeny.

In an evolutionary sense, much of the animal kingdom has been at war with them for a very long time. These snakes belong to a family called elapids, which evolved around 37 million years ago and spread across the globe. Along the way, they developed adaptations that made the world a much more dangerous place for vertebrates. One key adaptation was venom that targets an ancient Achilles heel found in the nervous systems of vertebrates.

This neurotoxic venom caused species across the vertebrate family tree to become locked in an evolutionary arms race. For some, it was a challenge to adapt to; for others, it was a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions. Humans were no exception—our ancestors were also vulnerable to elapids.

Despite their diversity and notoriety, elapids are a relatively recent addition to the snake lineage. While snakes as a group have existed for over 100 million years, molecular analyses date the earliest elapids to around 37 million years ago, with fossil evidence starting at 25 million years ago. Once on the scene, they diversified rapidly and spread across the world, becoming one of the most successful snake families, with about 300 species, including some of the deadliest snakes like cobras, black mambas, and coral snakes.

Their success is largely due to their venom delivery system. Unlike many other snakes with solid fangs at the back of their mouths, elapids developed hollow, syringe-like fangs at the front, capable of delivering venom at high pressure. While some other snake families, such as vipers, have slow-acting venom that destroys tissues, elapid venom is primarily neurotoxic, causing paralysis and rapid death by disrupting nerve signal transmission.

The venom binds to nervous system receptors deeply rooted in vertebrate evolution. By doing so, it blocks nerve signals, disrupting critical functions like movement and breathing, leading to death in hours or minutes. This lethal combination triggered an evolutionary arms race, forcing vertebrate species to develop defenses against the venom.

One remarkable example of this arms race involves caecilians, a group of legless amphibians. Researchers have found that caecilians independently evolved resistance to elapid venom at least 15 times across different lineages. These adaptations ranged from mutations blocking venom binding to altering receptor shapes and charges, rendering the venom ineffective. This widespread resistance highlights the extreme selection pressure imposed by elapids.

In parallel, primates also evolved resistance to elapid venom. Resistance was strongest in the last common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, likely due to repeated encounters with cobras in Africa. As our ancestors spent more time on the ground, interactions with cobras became more frequent, leading to the evolution of partial resistance. However, this resistance does not make humans immune—caution around venomous snakes remains essential.

Interestingly, humans may have inadvertently influenced cobra evolution. By using tools like sticks to defend against snakes, early humans might have driven some cobras to develop "ranged" weapons, leading to the evolution of spitting cobras.

The rise of elapids illustrates the interconnectedness of life. The adaptations and counter-adaptations between predators and prey reveal how a single group can influence the evolutionary trajectories of countless species, from amphibians to primates.
