Jesus opened his ministry “I am that I am”. He claimed to be God, the self existing one. The same that had communed with Abraham and Moses. 

You are Jesus. Joseph Campbell says as much. But so does the Bible many times. Christians take up the cross. We are all one in the body of Christ. This hits harder in the Jesus myth interpretation.

This is a super common theme in mythology. Odin and Dionysus.

In The Ritual I think it was origianlly a self-sacrifice. Your own death was enacted ritually so that you may be reborn (spiritually). Body releases DMT when you die. Acid trip looks like a super stressful event on brain scans. Demeter and Isis put foreign male kids in the fire.

Common element in male initiation rituals. Plains Indians literally crucified then lose a finger to remember. Most cave art is missing fingers. Dozens of cultures have this practice.

# Bible VersesGalatians 2:20: "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." Paul here implies that his old self has died with Christ on the cross, and his new life is the life of Christ living within him.

Romans 6:3-5: "Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his." This passage strongly connects believers with the death and resurrection of Christ.

2 Corinthians 4:10: "We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body." This verse suggests that the experiences of Jesus - both his death and his life - are carried within the believer.

Philippians 3:10-11: "I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead." This verse explicitly states Paul's desire to participate in the experiences of Christ, including his sufferings and death, in order to attain resurrection.

Matthew 16:24-25: "Then Jesus told his disciples, 'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.'"

John 15:4-5: "Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."

1 John 4:17: "This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus."

Luke 9:23: "And he said to all, 'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.'"

1 Peter 2:21: "To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps."

**John 2:19-21**: "Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.' The Jews then said, 'It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?' But he was speaking about the temple of his body."**Matthew 24:1-2**: "Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. But he answered them, 'You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.'"**Mark 13:1-2**: "As he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, 'Look, Teacher, what large stones and what large buildings!' Then Jesus asked him, 'Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.'"**Luke 21:5-6**: "And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said, 'As for these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.'"**Matthew 27:51**: "And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split."The veil of the Temple separated the Holy of Holies—the innermost and most sacred area where God's presence was believed to reside—from the rest of the Temple. Only the high priest could enter this space, and only once a year on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. When the veil tore, it symbolized that through Jesus' death, all people now had direct access to God.
