Theory: ruminating produces agriculture.

evidence: agriculture always springs up around alcohol, possibly part of how we stopped being bicameral.

women tend to prefer consistent food. Gathering vs hunting. Farming is another source of consistent food. Additionally, they were probably conscious first. Could better worry about the future in abstract ways (and think of solutions). Farming not an adaptation like squirrel’s burying of nuts. Were the first farmers female?

### panspermia and agriculture


Why did everyone get agriculture at the same time. Quite a good hypothesis about warmer climate + extinct megafauna: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/ES10-00098.1

But also, conscious is memetic. Maybe alien panmemia?

Gonna start with a warning of epistemic status: speculative dorm room drunk. Very low probability of being correct. This is more in the vein of playing with ideas, and trying to understand what we can’t explain.

Have argued elsewhere that Agriculture was a result of rumination. Once we started becoming less bicameral, we worry more about the future and start farming. Becoming less bicameral may also have involved alcohol, which farming also helps.

Bicameral →modern transition is mostly memetic. If this transition usually results in agriculture, why do we observe unconnected people developing agriculture at similar times? Is the Bicameral →cognition →agriculture transition simply inevitable once there are enough people?

Could also be soft evidence in favor of panspermia theory. That life on earth comes from space, and we may be watched by aliens. Some of my favorite thinkers (Robin Hansen, marginal revolution guy) put non-negligible probability of current UFO evidence being real. That there are aliens observing us, mostly not wanting to be observed. Maybe they are interested in consciousness, and put their thumb on the scale.

### What was the fruit?


Women prefer wine, men prefer beer. There are rabbis who think Adam first ate wheat, and eve drank wine
