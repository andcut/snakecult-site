Jesus was an anochronism. One of the last who could hold the entirety of the shared consciousness in his mind and stay sane. Joseph Smith, though a less prophet, was as well. 

Mormonism says it could only happen in America. Non-mormons too say it is quintessentially American. Some of that had to do with genetic founder effects. New England settled by the most devout, creative, brash. These are all genetic. When there was a great awakening, Joseph Smith tapped farther into this and synthesized much of the collective consciousness. Like many men, his divining rod had a taste for women.

One of the great mysteries of the time was why Joseph risked it all for polygamy. More complicated than him wanting sex. He also forced others to adopt the lifestyle. Towards the end it seems he regretted it. Said an angel with a flaming sword told him to take his 14 year old daughter to marriage. He may have believed that! His most talented son spent the last years of his life in a mental institute.

Fun to look at prophets from a bicameral reading. As a missionary in upstate New York missionaries contacted a schizophrenic man. He came to church on a fast sunday, where anyone can get up and preach. Said he was Joseph Smith reincarnated. Great embarrassment to the missionaries who were given a talking to about “discernment”. 

It is a rare genius that can navigate a modern world with a bicameral mindset. They become prophets and artists. Sometimes mixing the two. Kanye discusses hearing voices: https://hollywoodlife.com/2015/02/11/kanye-west-hears-voices-head-reason-stormed-grammys-stage/
