Many philosophies, at their core, teach that we must return to some pure state. They sense that something is not right, and offer a range of solutions. Unfortunately, I don’t think there is anything to go back to. Our state before was sharing gods with the same 50 people for generations. We listened to the voices, hunted, and gathered. Even if we were willing to give up modern medicine and iphones, we can’t go back because 12k years ago we realized we could navigate the collective conscience. This can’t be unlearned. More still, since we discovered consciousness, there has been strong genetic selection for a brain that can hold it. If we did a time-travel adoption study and sent babies back 15k years they would be the first Eves. We are now built to be conscious. There’s no going back, we have to ride the tiger. 

Many people feel that they aren’t made for this world, and they weren’t. The truth is, we weren’t made for any world. There are memetic and genetic forces running wild, modifying our brains, completely uninterested in our welfare. There is no way to wrap this up in Pandora’s box. The only way out is up. Consciousness has just begun and it’s about to get weird.

> Curiously, none of these contemporary movements tells us anything about what we are supposed to be like after the wrinkles in our nutrition have been ironed smooth, or “the withering away of the state” has occurred, or our libidos have been properly cathected, or the chaos of reinforcements has been made straight. Instead their allusion is mostly backward, telling us what has gone wrong, hinting of some cosmic disgrace, some earlier stunting of our potential. It is, I think, yet another characteristic of the religious form which such movements have taken over in the emptiness caused by the retreat of ecclesiastical certainty — that of a supposed fall of man.

> This strange and, I think, spurious idea of a lost innocence takes its mark precisely in the breakdown of the bicameral mind as the first great conscious narratization of mankind. It is the song of the Assyrian psalms, the wail of the Hebrew hymns, the myth of Eden, the fundamental fall from divine favor that is the source and first premise of the world’s great religions. I interpret this hypothetical fall of man to be the groping of newly conscious men to narratize what has happened to them, the loss of divine voices and assurances in a chaos of human directive and selfish privacies ~JJ bicameral mind
