For statistical reasons, the best evidence of global cultural diffusion is how often the Pleiades star cluster represents Seven Sisters. This is surprising, given only six stars are visible, and the “missing sister” is often a plot point in the story. It boggles the mind how that could emerge independently in places as distant as Australia, South America, and Europe. In the literature, every treatment I’m aware of concludes these stories share a common root deep in the past.A story that old is a view into the Stone Age. For it to last so long, it must embed some timeless advice, right? Well, maybe. I have focussed on serpents and bullroarers to understand the oldest layers of human culture because they are far more interpretable. Like clockwork, bullroarers are the voice of god, who takes the form of a serpent. The Pleiades sisters, however, are tight-lipped; their tales reveal no such obvious structure. This article puzzles on the thread that could go through Seven Sisters myths from California, Australia, and Egypt.# CaliforniaAcademics are deeply embarrassed by the idea that myths could be about something. Previous generations had tried to track down Atlantis or find proof of Noah’s flood; any project that rhymes with those attempts is deeply uncool (and probably problematic in some way). In 2011, Harvard philologist Michael Witzel tried to track down the origins of the world’s mythologies. He noticed that essentially all cultures have a story of a great flood. Most people would relate this to the end of the Ice Age when sea levels rose 100 meters over thousands of years. Not Witzel. Because myths are not about real events, he posited that these stories go back to a myth constructed out of thin air 100,000 years ago and spread with humans when they left Africa. Variations are remembered to this day. Somehow, this codes as the serious man’s model.

Anthropologist Chris Knight is a rare exception in that he believes myths are informative to deep human history. His journey mirrors my own. We both started with an idea for the beginning of human culture. EToC posits that culture is built on understanding the radical notion *“I am.”* Or, a bit more developed, *“I am a moral agent who will one day die,”* as recalled in Genesis. For Knight, culture is built on top of a sex strike. Women banded together to deny men sex unless they shared their spoils from hunting. This bargain was the beginning of culture and is remembered in myths and rituals worldwide, particularly in primitive societies[^1]. Both our theories took form with an epiphany about the Cosmic Serpent. In the introduction, he describes the moment he grasped the worldwide myth:

*Its meaning was not a thing. It referred not to something external to the human subject. It was - I decided when the first dawnings of understanding began to hit me - pure subjectivity. It was solidarity. It was my class struggle. It was the picket line, the blood-red flag, the many-headed Dragon of resistance. It was the overthrow of Primate Capitalism - the triumph of the great Sex Strike which had established the cultural domain.*It’s uncanny to read the same realization—the serpent represents (or offers) subjectivity—and then see him go full communist instead of dwelling on how culture interacts with subjectivity itself. As he explains it:

*“But the chief value of a study of human origins, from my political perspective, is that it demonstrates, firstly, that early life was communist (Engels 1972 [1884]; Lee 1988). Secondly, it teaches us that revolution lies at the very heart of what we are.”*Be that as it may, he is the only one I’m aware of to take a stab at interpreting the Seven Sisters as a cultural memory. What follows is his treatment (Blood Relations, page 143):

*A Californian myth tells of Seven Sisters who used their collective sexual solidarity as a weapon against husbands who refused to provide them with game. The myth was recorded in Los Angeles County early in the nineteenth century: *The Seven Sisters 

There were seven brothers married to seven sisters , who lived in a large hut together. The men went daily to hunt rabbits and the women to gather roots of flags for food. The husbands invariably reported 'bad luck' in their hunt, with the exception of the youngest, who, without fail, handed his wife a rabbit. This continued every day until the females held a conference and became convinced that they were being cheated by their partners. They agreed that the youngest sister should remain at home the next day, under pretext of having a pain in her jaw, and so watch the return of the party. Next day the men as usual took their bows and arrows and set forth. The six sisters then departed, leaving the other concealed among the flags and rushes at the back of the hut in a position from which she could see all that happened inside. Several hours before sunset the hunting party returned laden with rabbits which they commenced roasting and eating, except one which the youngest set apart. The others called him a fool and bade him eat the remaining one, which he refused to do, saying he still had some affection for his wife and always intended to reserve one for her. More fool you, said the others; we care more for ourselves than for these root-diggers. When they had finished, they carefully hid all the evidence of their feast. When all this was later reported to the sisters, they cried a great deal and talked over what they should do. Let us turn into water, said the eldest. That would never do , responded the rest, for in that case our husbands would drink us. The second proposed being turned into stones, which was rejected on the ground of being trodden upon by the fraternity . The third wanted them to turn themselves into trees, which was not accepted because they would be used for firewood. Everything proposed was put aside until it came to the turn of the youngest. Her proposition to change themselves into stars was objected to on account of being seen, but overruled as they would be out of reach. 

 They proceeded to the lagoon, where they daily collected flag roots and constructed a machine (impossible to describe) out of reeds, and ascended to heaven and located themselves at the Pleiades. These seven stars still retain the names of the originals. (Reid 1939: 246-8; slightly adapted and abridged).

*With its emphasis on the sisters' not wanting their husbands to use or enjoy them - to 'drink' , 'tread on' or 'burn' them - this myth suggests that 'becoming stars' , tantalisingly visible but out of reach in the sky, is a metaphor for collective sexual withdrawal. The reader who follows this book to the end will link this in turn with actual or pretended menstruation as a pretext for seclusion in 'another world'. This would make the 'machine' which is 'impossible to describe' , and which is associated with female collectivity around a 'lagoon', a code term for female synchronised menstruation (see Chapters 11- 14).*This does sound like a story that women would tell men when they go off to hunt. And it is at least consistent with a sex strike, though being that generous, there are dozens of other interpretations just as consistent. (For example, women teach men rules as part of the “I am a moral agent who will one day die” package.)

Really I should first read: **The Seven Sisters of the Pleiades: Stories from Around the World**Intro

California

Chris Knight’s story parallels mine in a commie universe.

Story is about sharing food.

Fits fairly well into “I am a moral agent who will one day die”

Australia

Related to Dreamtime ceremonies

Egypt

Related to Hathor, who in turn is related to alchemy.

This is similar to the Dreamtime ceremonies (alchemy tells the same story).

Show the “perfected man” image, and relate it to Nuwa.

Also related to agriculture. Maybe the share-your-food motif?

Don’t get too comfortable

How does this apply to the Greek version? https://lucindariley.co.uk/myths-and-legends/

Kind of a greatest-hits of female goddesses? The brightest could be the Great Mother or Nurse. Others have to do with sailing…used in navigation?

Or the Onandoga: https://mythcrafts.com/2020/05/01/the-stars-who-fed-us-the-onondaga-and-the-seven-sisters/ 

Part of ecstatic dance?

Or the Mono Indians: https://lucindariley.co.uk/myths-and-legends/

Wives kicked out by husbands because they ate too much onions. (Witches?)

Conclusion

Maybe someone Seven Sisters scholar could synthesize a message between all these stories. It’s beyond me. It seems more like an ancient motif which has accrued thousands of years of detritus. For statistical reasons, the motif is still detectable. For us, that is the most important function: the implication of *other* motifs that have survived. But to understand the meaning, it’s easier to look to thematic elements closer to the heart of the original package: serpents, matriarchy, and bullroarers.Doing some shorter bits 

Blood Relations: Menstruation and the origins of culture

In attributing creative agency to females in establishing the cultural realm, Knight turns Lévi-Strauss upside-down, claiming that his new theory is more simple, parsimonious and consistent with the rest of science. In his view, the human revolution – the momentous transition from nature to culture – is eventually consummated when females successfully mount collective resistance to male sexual thoughtlessness or abuse.

Introduce with this text from 1885: https://www.online-literature.com/andrew_lang/custom-and-myth/7/ 

“Now it is time to prove the truth of our assertion that the star-stories of savage and of civilised races closely resemble each other. Let us begin with that well-known group the Pleiades. The peculiarity of the Pleiades is that the group consists of seven stars, of which one is so dim that it seems entirely to disappear, and many persons can only detect its presence through a telescope. The Greeks had a myth to account for the vanishing of the lost Pleiad. The tale is given in the 'Catasterismoi' (stories of metamorphoses into stars) attributed to Eratosthenes. This work was probably written after our era; but the author derived his information from older treatises now lost. According to the Greek myth, then, the seven stars of the Pleiad were seven maidens, daughters of the Giant Atlas. Six of them had gods for lovers; Poseidon admired two of them, Zeus three, and Ares one; but the seventh had only an earthly wooer, and when all of them were changed into stars, the maiden with the mortal lover hid her light for shame.

Now let us compare the Australian story. According to Mr. Dawson ('Australian Aborigines'), a writer who understands the natives well, 'their knowledge of the heavenly bodies greatly exceeds that of most white people,' and 'is taught by men selected for their intelligence and information. The knowledge is important to the aborigines on their night journeys;' so we may be sure that the natives are careful observers of the heavens, and are likely to be conservative of their astronomical myths. The 'Lost Pleiad' has not escaped them, and this is how they account for her disappearance. The Pirt Kopan noot tribe have a tradition that the Pleiades were a queen and her six attendants. Long ago the Crow (our Canopus) fell in love with the queen, who refused to be his wife. The Crow found that the queen and her six maidens, like other Australian gins, were in the habit of hunting for white edible grubs in the bark of trees. The Crow at once changed himself into a grub (just as Jupiter and Indra used to change into swans, horses, ants, or what not) and hid in the bark of a tree. The six maidens sought to pick him out with their wooden hooks, but he broke the points of all the hooks. Then came the queen, with her pretty bone hook; he let himself be drawn out, took the shape of a giant, and ran away with her. Ever since there have only been six stars, the six maidens, in the Pleiad. This story is well known, by the strictest inquiry, to be current among the blacks of the West District and in South Australia.

Mr. Tylor, whose opinion is entitled to the highest respect, thinks that this may be a European myth, told by some settler to a black in the Greek form, and then spread about among the natives.”

as Bacon prettily says, that we listen to the harsh ideas of earlier peoples 'blown softly through the flutes of the Grecians.'

He never answers the Pleiade question! Just says that in general savage minds think like savages, and greece inherited the ideas of savages.

# Egypt“This goddess has been multiplied into the group of the “seven Hat-hors” who foretell the future, especially of every child at his birth. The suspicion that these seven fates were originally the Pleiades, which, among certain other nations, were the constellation of human fate (especially of ill-omened fate), and also the foretellers of the harvest,14 is confirmed when we find the “ seven Hat-hor cows with their bull”; for the Pleiades are in the constellation of Taurus. Since this zodiacal sign is not Egyptian, the New Empire probably borrowed from Asia the connexion of constellations which we have described, although they failed to understand it. Various efforts were made to localize the single forms of these seven Hat-hors in Egyptian cities.”

In egypt the Pleiades are connected to Hathor as 7 cows.

Classicist argues that Hathor is connected to a snake cult, and the origin of alchemy.
