If you administer a broad range of cognitive tasks and do factor analysis about 40% of the variance will be explained by PC1. This is called g and you can get a lot of mileage out of this number without any subsequent factors. Thurstone invented factor analysis because he thought there may be multiple latent variables that explained personality, as opposed to intelligence. It turns out you need roughly five PCs to capture personality, and all of them together aren’t as predictive as g for many life outcomes [is this true]. In this way, intelligence research is a victim of its own success. We live in a democratic and post WWII world where ranking people on socially valued traits violates sacred norms. Perhaps it is not surprising then that those who value intelligence (the educated), are more likely to say it can’t be measured (IQ isn’t real). [cite some study.]

My view is that personality is as real as intelligence. How people interact with the world is at least as driven by traits like honor or extraversion as it is by compute power. It is, however, much more difficult to measure. This is due to self-report, as well as being situational. Intelligence can be measured with items where there is one correct answer while personality cannot. If g were measured by asking “are you good at math”, then it’s predictive power would be much less impressive (as well as polluted by things like self-esteem and friend group). Further, personality is situational. For example, my father is very much an introvert except when speaking his second language Spanish, in which case he becomes the life of the party. It’s hard to capture those nuances.

This debate actually goes back to Galton. He loved surveys, but also discussed judging character by having subjects play games, and longitudinal observational studies. Meta is probably the entity in the best position to measure personality, with their decade-long history of a significant part of the world’s social life. As an ad company, they have little incentive to model personality writ large. But they are immensely interested in predicting what you will buy, and what will keep you scrolling. So on these two aspects of personality, we can assume they have very sophisticated models (even if they are not a list of named dimensions, as psychologists are fond of). Meta sells this incredibly sophisticated personality model as Lookalike Audiences. You put in a list of people who you already know are interested, and FB finds what unites their behavior and finds other people for you to target. Psychometrically, it is a thing of beauty.

Segue to Cambridge Analytica. CA claimed finer targeting using … the Big Five. Really! That was the sell. They would reduce the incredible complexity of FB data to five dimensions not designed to predict bad clicks or political orientation, then use THAT to magically find those that could be swayed to vote for Trump. Bringing a butter knife to a gunfight. 

In the second year of my PhD I independently produced the same models as CA. They take in FB data and predict Big Five personality, intelligence, Sensational Interests (do you like guns? vampires?) and political orientation. It’s published and available here. I was shocked to hear of this company, which had a) done the same thing b) claimed it could help win elections c) gotten people very very angry.

The most important lens to understand this is journalistic malfeasance amplified by internet hysterics. Somebody had to pay for Trump’s victory and who better than psychometricians and tech. Psychological warfare vs Obama and the power of friendship. What the article describes Obama doing is far creepier than Trump’s team (identify friends that can be swayed and tell obama supporters to reach out to them). Which is all to say I’m not naive enough to think truth matters much in politics or public opinion, but I would like to set the record straight (if belatedly). 

When I heard about CA, I couldn’t understand why they would use those models when FLA exists. It turns out their data science team thought the same thing and just used FLA. According to WIRED “”. See, that is clever, if fairly obvious. Hillary Clinton should have done something like that and she would have been president. 

Conclusion: psychometrics gives people the ick. Personality psychology is protected by not being very accurate. If it gets better, expect more pushback. In the meantime make sure all your personal communications are over Meta’s Messenger so they can adequately model your backstory when you are uploaded to the Metaverse. And lastly, the whole CA thing was Fake News.
