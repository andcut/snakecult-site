Embryo selection works. Most common popular argument against it is that it will increase inequality. Solve this by paying for everyone to get embryo selection. This is state sponsored eugenics

Big win for techno-optimists. 20th century eugenics had many ancillary goals including racial purity. But the central goal and namesake was good genes. That is a very real and admiral concern. Technology allows us to accomplish it without death camps, sterilization, or fascists deciding whose line will continue.

Embryo selection puts power in the hands of companies and parents. There are some problems with this. Parents may want to select for children with blonde hair, blue eyes, big brains, and girthy dicks. I think this is way less likely to be abused than many other rights we give to parents. 

Will be strong pressure to find pgs for babies that are not fussy. I also consider it problematic that companies may want to shy away from traits like IQ. We live in a sick culture that only intervenes for problems. 

Note: the inequality argument could not even pass a rawlsian sniff test. If a rich person’s child doesn’t have heart disease they are more likely to invent cold fusion (longer life, better circulation, fewer distractions). At any rate they will consume less health care, which is distributed across everyone. Could be second-order political effects if rich people did not have health problems and so discontinued our (meager) public healthcare. But embryo selection is not that good. 

**upsides:**

smarter, healthier, wealthier

Think of a health problem in your family. Do you wish you could be born with 30% reduced odds of that being a major reducer in life quality and duration? Do you wish that for your neighbor?

can stack on any other social program. Should we reduce lead in the environment? Sure! Expand Medicare? Why not? Also, let’s select for smarter babies.

**Downsides:**

less genetic diversity

works better for anglos (though long term will work better for mixed-race—hybrid vigor—or chinese)

parents may want bad traits (more schizophrenia)

may produce weird pressures on the kids to be super smart or athletic

slippery slope to embryo editing which doesn’t have the same safeguards

**Limitations:**

It’s hard to understand the role of rare genes. If few people have them it’s unclear what their phenotypic results are. Likewise, it’s hard to tease out non-additive genetic behavior.

Just means we can’t expect too much from embryo selection for new phenotypes like Big Five personality.
