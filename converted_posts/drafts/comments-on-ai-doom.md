[Stetson shared in a Note](https://substack.com/@stetson/note/c-59213018?utm_source=activity_item):

“This debate isn’t going away and has been finding its way into mainstream public discourse. I think it will be good to move the public away from a prior of Skynet-like endgame.”

I wasn’t covering the absolutely most important info to my beliefs. Rather, focused on uncorrelated knowledge. For humans there is a tight package: a) acting agentically b) feeling they are agentic c) general intelligence. I don’t think that holds for AI. Hence citing chollet and lecun saying similar things. And also spending time on microtubules. Let me pull that lever again. 

  1. Lots of biology uses quantum

  2. Evolution tends to use useful things

  3. Not at all strange to me that brains (or even cells) would have started as essentially quantum computers. 

    1. especially considering microtubules…do show quantum effects (for something totally different.

  4. If this is so, then ASI really is just scifi

  5. Once again, this isn’t the strongest arg against AGI. I bring it up to show that AGI timelines do depend on beliefs about consciousness, and many of the doomers assume that computationalism is the only answer. They should carry much more uncertainty about that.

    1. Head of interpretability research says #1 priority is understanding AI consciousness: <https://twitter.com/norabelrose/status/1802591113905107334>

    2. Also consciousness research and human/animal differences is an extremely difficult and political field. Very bad sign that Doom rests on one interpretation.

    3. They frequently bring in just nuts ideas, such as the comparison between parameters and neurons. 

  6. I also wrote to prod Hinton on being completely incoherent. He thinks chatbots have feelings (!), we’re all going to die very soon, but we should do basically nil, and that Google has handled AI well. Doomers should take such sloppy thinking as a red flag, instead of blindly parading around his p(doom)

    1. Part of why I wrote the article is Doomers are so group-thinky

    2. “To me this reads as if the time you spent on thinking about what is true was dwarfed by the time you spent looking over your shoulder wondering what people will think of you once you publish it.”

    3. "Nothing to worry about because we will start worrying soon."




I think Chollet larger point will be vindicated, even though his benchmark has already fallen https://x.com/dwarkesh_sp/status/1802771055016378554

Give Hameroff a follow. Spend his retirement dunking on a job advertisement

'I think more like a quantum Buddhist in that there is a universal proto-conscious mind wich we can access, and can influence us.'

Calls OrchOR “pseudoscience”. So does this paper: https://myweb.ecu.edu/bierm/papers/Skeptic2010.pdf

But Sabine is more fair:
