The two models make predictions. Let’s see how they play out.

Jung via Neuman talks about how ontology recapitulates phylogeny. That is, the Ouroborus is associated with pre-ego consciousness in mythology b/c the human species passed through an ouroborus state deep in the past.

Can interpret this in an idealist way a la Kastrup: the world mind grows matter and our own minds. Or in a materialist way similar to evo-psych. Doesn’t really matter, the model does not require cultural transmission.

The other explanation is diffusion. The meaning of the ouroborus is a historical accident, and it’s widespread nature is due to diffusion. Had the first religion worshipped fish, fungi, or fettucini, then those would be associated with consciousness.

Australia:

  * No rainbow serpent before 6-10kya. He brings the dreamtime rituals

  * In some places, those that bring the dreamtime rituals are said to show up on canoes. 

    * x-ray style art

    * new stone tools

    * from the north

    * new language

  * There isn’t nothing before 8kya, but it’s extremly primitive. Arguably not Behaviorally Modern




Americas

  * Not so much as a bead before Clovis Culture

  * Immediately start with the snake stuff

    * 40 meter mural

    * 7.5 meter mural is clearly an ancestor of Quetzalcoatl. (like lucifer, associated with venus)




Gobekli Tepe:

  * Western culture also had a snake phase




Bullroarer

  * Central to the package that diffused.

  * Jungians actually have had to 




Not strictly speaking anti collective unconscious. One could still argue the collective consciousness works in mysterious ways (sending bullroarer emmissaries). But similarity of the snake is often presented as evidence of the collective consciousness. It is not.
