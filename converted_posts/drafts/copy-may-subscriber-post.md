One of the popularizers of Bufo toad venom (5-meo-DMT) can be seen spinning a bullroarer during the ceremony at minute 18:08:

He claims to have revived a psychedelic tradition from an almost extinct tribe. A [critical piece](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/03/28/the-pied-piper-of-psychedelic-toads) in the New Yorker at least corroborates the existence of the myth: 

_A few Seri people I spoke with said that they’d heard stories of a secret ancient toad-smoking practice. But, as Alberto Mellado Moreno, a historian from the Seri tribe, said, “It’s speculative even for us. Consider a society reconstructed from so few survivors. It’s impossible to know what might have been lost.”_

The seerstones Urim and Thummim were apparently important to the Rosecrucians. Notably, Joseph Smith claimed to use them to translate the Book of Mormon from the “Reformed Egyptian” of the Native Americans. Since the 1950s, Mormons have aggressively rebranded as just another Christian sect, which underplays the degree they are a Western esoteric tradition.

Found this image in a paper that didn’t mention Mormons at all: The Urim and Thummim and the Origins of the Gold-und Rosenkreuz

Another take of LLMs as antichrist, very similar to my own:  
  
”The Antichrist is, by definition, negative and dependent. It rejects Christ and Christian values while offering a spurious imitation of them. AI is a similarly dependent being. It is a simulacrum of human intelligence and language, capacities of thought and speech the Greeks called _logos_. But AI lacks essential elements of human logos: its embeddedness in the world through birth in a body bound for death, and the moral and intellectual interiority that makes the human being an image of God.” https://unherd.com/2025/05/peter-thiels-visions-of-apocalypse/

Interesting research that tries to have “race is a social construct” at the same time identifiable by heart scans.

Different models learn the same embeddings: https://x.com/jxmnop/status/1925224612872233081

In passing, discusses Penrose’s theory of quantum consciousness. Penrose, apparently, was surprised that a computer could learn Go, as he thought there was something quantum about that type of human creativity that would not be replicated on a computer. Some evidence against the theory.

[Picuris Pueblo oral history and genomics reveal continuity in US Southwest](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9) | Nature

Hopi are related to Mexicans, precede Navajo in the area: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9

Current state of the field: “Previous studies have shown that Native American genomic ancestry featured two early splits, taking place between 22 and 14.6 thousand years ago (ka)[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR7),[58](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR58),[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR59),[66](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR66),[67](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR67), giving rise to three main lineages. The first group to diverge were Ancient Beringians, represented by 11.5–9-ka-old individuals from Alaska[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR7),[67](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR67). This is followed by a split that gave rise to two extra lineages; one that includes mainly speakers of Athabascan and Algic languages, as well as groups in the Pacific Northwest[58](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR58),[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR59), whereas the other comprises all other previously studied Native Americans, including all ancient South Americans, and are represented by a roughly 12.8 ka individual of the Clovis culture (‘Anzick1’)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR5).”

There is a ghost population! “Using _D_ statistics of the form _D_(ancientPicurisPueblo, Karitiana, Anzick, Yorubas)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR5),[61](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR61) we found a significant rejection (_D_ = −0.017; _Z_ = −4.19) of ancient individuals from Picuris forming a clade with Southern Amazonian Karitiana to the exclusion of Anzick1, indicating Picuris carries ancestry that is not entirely from the lineage represented by Anzick1, a similar signal found in some North Mexican populations[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR7),[71](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR71),[72](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#ref-CR72) (Supplementary Figs. [25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#MOESM1)–[31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08791-9#MOESM1)). However, when directly testing whether those populations carry instead ancestry from the other lineage in the form _D_(pop, Karitiana, test, USR1.11,500 BP) we found all to be consistent with zero (maximum _D_ = 0.011, _Z_ = 1.82 for LaPlaya.600 BP and ‘CanAmerindian_1’), suggesting our dataset does not include a suitable proxy for the excess ancestry not represented in Anzick1 found in Picuris and other populations. This probably represents either ancestry more basal than the one found in the Anzick1 genome, or an ancestry source very distantly related to the ones with genetic data available.”

Every single continent has a ghost population:

Mormonism:

Common thread of weak fathers and mothers believing their children are possessed. My theory is that Utah Mormons are given to this sort of thing and and the Mormon church is something of a bulwark.

Very funny that Playa Del Carmen is full of right-wing refugees.

There is an Indian nationalist account on Instagram that [links](https://www.instagram.com/myth_or_history/reels/?next=%2Fpondsidehk%2Ftagged%2F&locale=%E8%B6%B3%E7%90%83%E6%8A%95%E6%B3%A8%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%87%BA%E7%A7%9F%E2%96%8BTG%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1hga1199%E2%96%8B%E7%9A%87%E5%86%A0hga%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%87%BA%E7%A7%9F%E5%87%BA%E5%94%AE%E3%80%96Telegram%E9%A3%9E%E6%9C%BAmos070809%E3%80%97%E7%9A%87%E5%86%A0%E8%B6%B3%E7%90%83%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E7%99%BB3%E5%87%BA%E7%A7%9F%E2%96%B2%E7%94%B5%E8%AF%9D16762944448%E2%96%BC.sCCQ) my piece on the Y Chromosome Bottleneck. I reached out and it turns out that they couldn’t find the original research (which I link and cite), and interpret my article as support for the Out of India theory. It’s a wild world out there.

Comment on Bullroarer:

After reading this and a couple other of your posts, I wanted to share a few things you may find interesting (if you haven't already read them).

First is Corman McCarthy speculating on the origin of language. <https://nautil.us/the-kekul-problem-236574/>

A linguists response <https://nautil.us/a-linguist-responds-to-cormac-mccarthy-236622/>

And another response from McCarthy <https://nautil.us/cormac-mccarthy-returns-to-the-kekul-problem-236896/>

Second is the book "Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking" by Cecilia Hayes.

EToC is very much an internet theory. When Dr. Tom Froese [riffed off the Stoned Ape Theory](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/the-origins-of-human-consciousness) to explain the symbolic revolution he did not draw attention to Mckenna et al. I have the luxury of leaning into it. But the internet is a double-edged sword, and I’m constantly reminded at how cheap words are there. Sometimes you’ll get an aggressive comment and then look at the person’s history and their feed is literally dozens of drive-byes every day. Imagine living like that! Anyway, though EToC is an internet theory, I do strive to choose my words carefully.

Desert Drifter is a lovely account that explores hard-to-find locations
