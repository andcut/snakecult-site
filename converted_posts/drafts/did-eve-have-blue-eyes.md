If you like crazy ideas, have I got a beauty for you. This post assumes that our evolution involved a bicameral phase, which we only recently emerged from, thanks to Eve. The case for those ideas are made here, and here. In brief, our first internal voices functioned as a simple mechanism to help us live the golden rule. The voices, which we interpreted as gods, told us to be good team players, for the most part. However, the voices may demand we build an enormous pyramid for our deceased king, or murder a random woman to appease the ghost of our wife.

Even when the voices made more reasonable demands, it is sometimes fit to defect. Further, it is good to be able to reflect when society is making competing demands. This is particularly true for women, who had to manage a network of relationships in order to stay in good standing, rather than acts of valor by hunting or warring.

If we believe that the account in genesis is based on real events, then we should look to some mutation that turned down the voice of the gods at the beginning of the memory of oral history. With this distance, Eve would have been able to reflect on voices rather than act on them. It turns out, the most obvious phenotypic result of the mutation may have been wideset blue eyes.

## Bringing Back Greek Gnosticism


Previous post claimed that genesis was essentially accurate about the fall from bicameralism. Using that understanding made claims that the first conscious human was a woman, and supplied some scientific reasons why.

This post does the same with Greek myths. Bit the bullet that these may be records of real events. Not just archetypal ‘events’ but accounts of real humans with all of their quirks. 

### Goddess eyes


[argue that Hera, Athena, and Pandora fill the role of Eve. Maybe even quote the classics professor’s takedown of that book making the same claim. “If you want to reject my theory, I’ll make it easy. This Christian made the same claim. Here is the review from a classic’s professor:”]

Special attention is given to Hera and Athena’s eyes. Hera is an ox, Athena is bright (like an owl). 

## Waardburg’s Paradox


Introduce the syndrome. Photos, and all all of the downsides. Imagine you’re the cleverest kid on the playground. Would you call them ox-eyed? Grey-eyed? Bright-eyed? I think the Greeks record just that.

Better call upon the umbrella: auditory-pigmentary disorders. These are quite heterogeneous. One explanation is that, in bicameral times, there was selection against the excesses of the voices. This is why there are so many deleterious APD that are autosomal dominant. 

## Neanderthals


Neanderthals had bigger eyes. And probably light eyes (find article that claims there is just too much diversity of eye color). What’s more, if we believe the transition happened shortly before agriculture (as Genesis says), then Gobekli Tepe is an excellent candidate. There are neanderthal caves not far from there.

## Turning down the gods


Also sometimes includes sensorineural deafness. My hypothesis is that this disrupted the auditory hallucination circuit. Eve had all the ability to model other minds, but not to hear them. Note: disrupt. I don’t think she was deaf or she would have had trouble communicating the knowledge. Perhaps the hallucinations just didn’t hit quite as hard.

[find some evidence that people can be sensorineurally limited, but have fine hearing. Can learn to talk.]

## Echoes in blue


Blue eyes are a mutation on OCA2. Waardburg implicates the same gene. Could Blue eyes be a watered down version of Waardburg syndrome? Paper is from 1956 so huge grain of salt. But look at those effects! Very few schizophrenic patients have blue eyes. Remember, I don’t consider schizophrenia to be an exact match to bicameral mind. The condition now represents a failure to identify with self in an agentic world, after ten thousand years of selection (memetic and genetic). But it is a decent model for a bad relationship with inner voice. And blue eyes seem protective. Note that they are not protective for other types of mental illness. Strangely, intermediate (mixed) eyes, have high rates of all types of illness in the study.

## Evolution of Blue Eyes


Study finds there is only one haplotype in all but one of the people with blue eyes. Must be the result of a fairly recent founder event (one person had the mutation and it spread like wildfire).

> The mutations responsible for the blue eye color most likely originate from the neareast area or northwest part of the Black Sea region, where the great agriculture migration to the northern part of Europe took place in the Neolithic periods about 6–10,000 years ago (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994). The high frequency of blue-eyed individuals in the Scandinavia and Baltic areas indicates a positive selection for this phenotype (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994; Bryant et al. 1997). Several theories has been suggested to explain the evolutionary selection for pigmentation traits which include UV expositor causing skin cancer, vitamin D deficiency, and also sexual selection has been mentioned. Natural selection as suggested here makes it difficult to calculate the age of the mutation. https://cdanielmadison.com/downloads/blue-eye-color-humans.pdf

There must be some advantage conferred. This happened around the time of the agricultural revolution, which supports the idea of a vitamin deficiency; our diets changed a lot. I also think there was a cognitive revolution. Could that explain this mutation?

## Eye color and personality


Big Five stuff

> The rationale of this paper is based on the logical reasoning that if competitiveness can be displayed in a physical form (Frost, 2006) then it may also be displayed -5- psychologically. Unlike Worthy (1974), it is argued that the predicted relationship between eye color and personality resulted from the higher need to be competitive in the North European climate. A competitive person is characterised by a tendency to be antagonistic, egocentric, and sceptical of others’ intentions rather than cooperative and, as such, could be expected to score low on a measure of Agreeableness. Since eye color is weakly sex-linked (Frost, 2006) we do not anticipate this phenomena to still be present in only females, we argue that light-eyed people, whatever their sex, would be more competitive psychologically than dark eyed people if they are of north European descent. Gardiner and Jackson 2010

Participants took booth NEO and BFI versions of the Big Five. Eye color was rated 1-5[quote scale]. The correlation between Agreeableness and eye color is a substantial 0.206 and 0.463 on the exams, respectively. And for Conscientiousness it is .110 and .271 respectively. 

My hypothesis is that there was selection _against_ unfit aspects of PFP. The naïve version is to treat others how they would like to be treated, which of course opens up oneself to abuse. There are also, by necessity, double-blinds where demands compete. Finally, sometimes it is fit to lie, cheat, and steal. Especially if you don’t get caught! The paper frames this as competitiveness, and measures it via Agreeableness. These are of course related, but my guess is a larger effect can be found on the PFP. Remember that the rotation of PFP to produce the Big Five resulted in it being split over Agreeableness and Conscientiousness.

Additionally, the mechanism I propose has to do with quieting the voices of the gods. Questions about activity of inner voice, dissociation, etc. Would be useful, as long as a measure of PFP.

Finally, the canadian study found a humped effect for schizophrenia. I wonder if it would be better to treat blue eyes as a categorical variable, rather than assigning a lightness scalar and regressing. 

## The Indian Record


I have a Wikipedia-level understanding of Indian history, so the best I can offer is the description of Adita by a Hindu priest on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-goddess-Aditi-in-Hinduism):

> ADITI is one of the most important goddesses of the Veda. She is the sky goddess, the wife of Prajāpati Kaśyapa whose name means “Clear Vision” and she is the mother of the gods.
> 
> Aditi means “the Primordial Vastness”, “the totality” “the integrated consciousness” “the undivided” — she is the first Goddess and gave birth to the Adityas who embody the laws of the Cosmos both Niskala and Sakala.
> 
> Aditi’s offspring therefore are the forces of Order in the Universe. Order in the cosmos and the psychic balance in the individual arise from an integrated and well harmonised consciousness - undivided.
> 
> Aditi’s co-wife was Diti whose name means “divided” or “split” consciousness. She had a deep animosity towards Indra and conceived a son who would kill him.

Wikipedia [adds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditi):

> **Aditi** ([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit): अदिति, lit. 'boundless' or 'limitless'[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditi#cite_note-3) or 'innocence'[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditi#cite_note-Jamison-Brereton-2015-1)) is an important [Vedic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) [goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess) in [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism). She is the personification of the sprawling infinite and vast cosmos. She is the goddess of motherhood, [unconsciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness), the [past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past), the [future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future) and [fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditi#cite_note-E-Brit-Aditi-4) She is the mother of the celestial deities known as the [adityas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adityas), and is referred to as the mother of many deities. As celestial mother of numerous beings, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space (_akasa_) and with mystic speech (_[Vāc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81c)_). She may be seen as a feminised form of [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma) and associated with the primal substance (_mulaprakriti_) in the [Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta). She is mentioned more than 250 times in the _[Rigveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda),_ the verses replete with her praise.

Where _[Vāc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81c)_ is “a personified form of speech.” Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but her symbol is that of a cow. Could it be a shared historical memory of Hera’s ox eyes? Stranger things have happened. Two hundred years ago the British were shocked to find cognates in Sanskrit. If vocabulary and grammar can survive the ages, can symbols of our creation? If the events happened, are they only preserved in the Judeo-Christian tradition?

## Recorded elsewhere?

## Future work


In summary, I hypothesized that 

Natural to wonder how I came up with such an unhinged idea. I learned that blue eyes evolved at around the time and place I suspected consciousness to have emerged. While googling some variation of “blue eyes mutation”, I ran into pictures of Waardenburg disease. This looked a bit ox-eyed, and I already thought that Eve may be represented by Athena and Hera in Greek mythology. That it also includes a sensorineural disruption—something that could turn down the voices of the gods—struck me as interesting enough to at least write down. From there I learned that blue eyes do indeed have surprising personality and mental health correlates; much stronger than one typically sees in the psychological sciences. Finally, as per my shallow knowledge goddesses associated with cows are often have to do with creation and consciousness. Their eyes are commonly mentioned as well.

Truly it’s a beautifully bizarre hypothesis. It’s also more amenable to the scientific method than other creations stories, including Jayne’s mostly-memetic account of bicameral breakdown.

Initially, I wonder if something like the 1954 study would replicate. Mturk survey that asks about eye color and a survey about their inner voice. How active is it? Do they hear/see hallucinations? If it replicates, would you then believe Eve had blue eyes? 

gardiner/jackson stuff. They should measure alpha rather than Big Five. This 

What sort of experiment would persuade you that the founding event for blue eyes had to do with cognition rather than sexual selection or vitamin deficiency? This is a good place to use preregistration and antagonistic collaboration. Get people to agree on what counts as good evidence _before_ collecting it.
