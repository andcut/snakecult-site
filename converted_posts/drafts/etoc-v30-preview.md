Greetings to my paid followers! I really appreciate the support. More than just the money, it signals that my writing provides value. 

I’ve written a 30,000-word version of the theory. It condenses some of the content in other posts and weaves in a bunch more research. Unfortunately, the length is causing technical difficulties, and there’s an error when I press “send.” Substack support will hopefully resolve that soon. However, until then, my most stalwart supporters can view it on this [secret draft link](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/38ba13ca-ec53-4561-877f-8c1453a54a16). 

Also, because this is the first paid subscriber post, feel free to introduce yourself in the comments. I’d like to start doing a little more community building, and am open to ideas about what that should look like.

Finally, a little bit of strategic vision. I have also written a post on archeo-astronomy that pulls together Gobekli Tep, Herakles, and Genesis. The statistical framing that star-stories allow makes it quite compelling. The hope is that it can be part of a 1-2 punch along with EToC v3; I’ll drop it after giving people some time to read the 30,000-word behemoth.
