The [Eve Theory of Consciousness](https://vectors.substack.com/p/the-eve-theory-of-consciousness) (EToC) is best described as a working hypothesis to explain the Sapient Paradox. As such, it’s helpful to have a condensed version:

  1. There was a psychological revolution ~15,000 years ago that produced abstract thought. This ought to be the wildest claim here, but it is in fact quite well established that _something_ dramatic changed around this time. The paper [Archaeological evidence for modern intelligence](https://cognitivearchaeologyblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/wynn-t-1991-archaeological-evidence-for-modern-intelligence-in-the-origins-of-human-behaviour-r-a-foley-ed-pp-52-66-unwin-hyman-london.pdf) goes so far as to argue that abstract thought is not apparent until 16,000 years ago. One doesn’t want to bite too hard on a single paper, but similar claims are made in the [Sapient Paradox](https://sci-hub.se/10.1098/rstb.2008.0010), which is fairly well accepted. It holds that some parts of what we consider fundamental aspects of human behavior (eg. creating sacred objects) were not present or were only regionally present until about 12,000 years ago.

    1. Of note, the going explanation is that our psychology did not fundamentally change, only our environment. Larger populations produced categorical advances in the type of culture we were able to produce. That this isn’t quite satisfactory is reflected in the name Sapient _Paradox_.

  2. We should be open to this change being as grand as the birth of the human condition. The moment we became self aware, natives of the symbolic realm, using language to contemplate abstractions in our private theater. We simply don’t know when or how those features of human psychology came to be, and there are reasons to believe they came in a bundle. What’s more, there are substantial problems with dates currently accepted as likely. For example Chomsky argues that language is the result of a single mutation in Africa 50,000-100,000 years ago, and this marked the beginning of the fully modern mind. This begs the question of why symbolic art only emerged 10,000 years later, and on a different continent. Or why religion wasn’t the norm for another 40,000 years. Language is useful. I think we should see evidence of abstract thought once it is in place.

    1. It’s best to try to defend the strongest version of the psychological change, as it is interesting if that can’t be rejected.

  3. Because this change started after humans left Africa, Sapience must have spread memetically over the whole world. Since then, there has been genetic selection so that this state is obtained consistently without intervention.

    1. This requires the human condition to have initially been discovered rather than innate[^1]. My model for this is that we were evolving circuitry to resolve social obligations. These calculations could have been done subconsciously, and we would have only been aware of the finished product as auditory hallucinations (eg. “share your food!”)[^2]. These would have been interpreted as the voices of the gods until someone introspected, perceived the whole process, and realized the woman behind the curtain was “I”.

  4. Some myths have survived from this time period and can be used to understand the nature of the psychological revolution. 

    1. If the human condition was initially discovered, Genesis is a very good description of what that would feel like: forcefully cast out of the Garden, into a world of pain. Man would not be copasetic having been dropped from nowhere into a mind palace. It’s hard to be God, grappling with is and ought, mind and body. What’s more, the old guard would not have gone down without a fight.

  5. Women discovered the self, and shared it with men, as described in Genesis.

  6. Similarly, self-awareness resulted in a transition to agriculture, as described in Genesis.




To be clear, the argument is not “because the Bible said so”. Creation is said to have happened [~6,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_6000) and yet we can be pretty sure that some stories have survived for 13,000 years. [For example](https://theconversation.com/ancient-aboriginal-stories-preserve-history-of-a-rise-in-sea-level-36010), some island-dwelling Australian Aboriginees have oral history that their homeland was once connected to the mainland. Their land was last a peninsula near the end of the last ice age, when the ocean was much lower. That is a long time to keep that fact alive.

If that oral history is true, EToC asks whether those who were indigenous to the Fertile Crescent may have something valuable to say about the cause of the Agricultural Revolution. We can then correlate those myths with evidence from archeology and psychology.

For most, 3 sticks out like a sore thumb. Consciousness spread memetically? Might as well say it was implanted by Lizard People. But I do think there is a reasonable mechanism, which I’ll explain more in the next post. It may or may not involve reptiles.

As a scientist, my first instinct is to falsify an idea. The subsequent posts will be about my failed attempts to do so. First, a more detailed look at how long myths can survive. Then a turn to linguistics. The invention of self should be reflected in language as the invention of the first person singular. If this was relatively recent, then there should be far-flung cognates for pronouns. This is the case to a remarkable degree.

Other people have spent decades studying neuroscience or linguistics or mythology; they are better equipped to evaluate narrow claims in EToC. (And I try to stay within the object-level bounds they set.) However, I do have some advantages as a generalist. I know more about genetics than the mythologists, more about psychometrics than the linguists, and more about religion than the psychologists. These are all brought to bear in EToC.

[Say something like consciousness being less well studied than physics, and me not reinventing the wheel. I am in line with the most popular theory in the 90s, but have a mechanism and different angle. It’s also tangentially related to psychometrics, natural language processing, and AI, all areas where I am an expert. The theory is coming from inside the house.

Why not publish? Well I don’t think I can find a coauthor, and the idea is so complex it’s hard to think of a journal + reviewers. It’s a strange beast that would take years to publish. It would be a massive massive time commitment. I think I can get a lot of the upside here on substack, where I am read by dozens of PhDs. People offer feedback, and I’m intrinsically motivated to make make good arguments and communicate my ideas to smart people.]

The opposite is the case. The more time you spend researching the more you learn how difficult the questions are whose answers would change our fundamental theories 2/3](https://twitter.com/martinmbauer/status/1617244463776030722)[7:35 PM ∙ Jan 22, 2023

Additionally, there are a number of reasons I can explore an idea like this but an expert in a relevant field may not be willing to. 

  1. It’s just weird. Not the type of theory that an archeologist could justify spending time on.

  2. It’s low status to use the Bible to generate hypotheses. 

  3. It’s [not](https://www.wired.com/story/the-pernicious-science-of-james-damores-google-memo/) [popular](https://leakeyfoundation.org/what-our-skeletons-say-about-the-sex-binary/) to argue for large psychological sex differences. 

  4. It’s [taboo to argue that the human condition is recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3VBCWIDEzk&t=7118s). 

  5. Diffusion is avoided as an explanation of cultural similarities as it is seen to undercut the receiver’s sophistication. For me it would be a big win to show EToC is _plausible_. That would not win an anthropologist any friends.

  6. Academia is becoming more specialized and this is highly interdisciplinary. It would be a hard sell to find a collaborator for this project.




Most theories about consciousness or our deep past are wrong. My hope is that EToC is at least wrong in an interesting way, which is also valuable. It _is_ odd that art and religion are not a universal phenomenon until the Holocene. Then, all at once, we see a worldwide shift. Maybe it was a cognitive development having to do with language. Or maybe it was the weather. It was warming up, after all.

[^1]: This would be fitting. What divides us from the animal kingdom is our ability to think in abstractions. It would be cool if, in the beginning, that was the result of memes as much as genes. One idea blossoming into a billions of minds which can’t stop thinking. The discovery of a new dimension also subject to the survival of the fittest.

[^2]: This is very similar to Julian Jaynes’s “Bicameral Mind”, though my interest is more on its evolution than phenomenology. I came to the idea of a hallucinated proto inner voice independently and was amazed to see it was already laying there in the literature, developed into an entire book with thousands of citations. He handles the philosophy and neuroscience well (though that field has come a long way since), but I take great issue with how little he thinks consciousness will alter our intellectual abilities and culture. He waxes eloquent about the “analog I” and its relation to consciousness, but does not ask when pronouns were invented. Further, I think there is a tighter relationship between abstract thought, religion, and self awareness. I don’t know when Jaynes thinks abstract thought emerged, but he thinks the Pyramids were planned and constructed 100% subconsciously.
