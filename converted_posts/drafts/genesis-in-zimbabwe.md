> **Mwari Drops Man from the Sky (Shona/Zimbabwe)**
> 
> Mwari is the supreme being, the giver of rain (he is also known as Dzivaguru, the Great Pool) and therefore the controller of fertility. He is both male and female, god of darkness and of light, god of the skies and of the earth. He is the creator, and is always present in what he has created. It was in the heavens that he created Musikavanhu. He caused him to sleep, then allowed him to fall from the sky. As he was falling, Musikavanhu awakened, and, looking about him, saw a stone that was also dropping from the sky. Both were moving rapidly. Mwari then spoke to Musikavanhu, instructing him to point at the stone with his finger. This Musikavanhu did, and as he did so the stone, moving at great speed, stopped. Then Musikavanhu moved to the stone, and as he did so, the stone became larger and larger, immense. Musikavanhu plummeted towards the stone, and then his speed lessened, and he moved quietly to the surface of the stone. When his feet touched it, the part that he touched became soft and water emerged. This place became known as the stone of the pool, called Matopos today, and held in sacred awe. Musikavanhu moved about on the surface of the stone, and at night he sat down near the place where Mwari had spoken to him, and he fell asleep. He had a dream: birds soared through the air, animals leapt about. When Musikavanhu awakened, what he had dreamed was reality: birds in the air, animals on the surface. Mwari then instructed Musikavanhu about what he could and could not eat: he could eat fruits and vegetables, but he must not touch the animals. And animals, too, did not eat each other. Again, Musikavanhu slept, and as he did so a **snake** moved over his body: he awakened, felt strange, had difficulty breathing, and his penis was as a **snake**. Again he called to Mwari and told him to go to the pool. As he went, he encountered a beautiful woman: she was sitting near the pool on a stone. They looked alike, but she was unable to move. The voice again came to him, instructing him to touch her. When he did so, she came to life: the **snake** moved across her body, and she felt what Musikavanhu had felt. Then Mwari told him how she must bathe, and how he must wash himself. And Mwari instructed Musikavanhu that if he did for her by God, he would return to heaven, and she would be the second god. He then instructed his children to live in peace with each other. Humans lived in peace in this creation. But later, humans became impudent about Musikavanhu’s children, and the people angered Mwari. God warned them, but they did not heed. God’s anger exploded: the voice of Mwari was heard beneath the ground, and huge trees appeared. Rivers overwhelmed people during the rainy season, and crocodiles emerged. The sun became hot, animals ate one another and assaulted humans. And men started to kill each other.

It’s like Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, and Noah all rolled into one.

    * “God as Creator is further qualified in relation to His creation by the interesting terms: Matangakugara (lit. You who sat or settled first) and Mawanikwa (You who were found to exist), which makes Him an eternal being, existing before anything else. Generally the act of creation is only vaguely described.”

I think the strongest argument against this being an actual African story (rather than a synchretism), is that there are a bunch of Christians in Africa who would love to find a “lost tribe.” Many of them are fairly well funded as well, such as those who write stuff like this: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283277018_Death_and_After-life_Rituals_in_the_eyes_of_the_Shona_Dialogue_with_Shona_Customs_in_the_Quest_for_Authentic_Inculturation   


If one writes a 500 page report of Shona and Christian beliefs and Shona kind of sort of have a creation story like the Bible, it seems that would come up.
