I’d like to continue writing about consciousness without linking people to hours of reading. 

The most basic idea, is that our “self” may have been the result of a the first introspection, and this could have happened after humans left Africa. This puts the event within the range of oral history, and opens up new lines of evidence to understand our beginnings. As in Genesis, I will give two versions. The first is narrative, which follows my own progression of thinking and establish why anyone should listen to me. The second is a barebones model that summarizes the theory.

# How I came to believe snake venom was involved in the evolution of languageMy dissertation explored how language models relate to personality structure. That is, according to how words are used, in what sense is introversion the opposite of extroversion, and is it correlated with Agreeableness or Conscientiousness. Basically, I was mapping personality space using character descriptions in every book ever written, as well as much of the text on the internet. For years I thought of this in evolutionary terms. Our psyche was forged in the fires of gossip, and I had the most accurate models of that fitness landscape.

In the course of trying to describe the evolutionary pressure of people talkin’ I did a little thought experiment: what would the first inner voice have said? Given the dominant moral valence of personality structure, it could have been something like “share your food!”. The voice of society in your head, put there by generations who survived by managing their reputation. 

Now imagine you are the first person to ever hear a voice in their head. What do you think? [Seems reasonable that this proto internal dialogue would be the discovery of gods](https://vectors.substack.com/p/consequences-of-conscience). “Is there a booming voice that tells you to do what’s right? Oh yeah that’s Ana, don’t worry about it.” It’s a harmless little thought experiment safely removed from modern psychology. There was a time without an inner voice? Sure, had to be if there was a time without language! But, what would it be like to realize that you were that voice? It would be understanding that you are the gods. Not only that, but peering inward would open up a whole hidden realm. The resulting psychology would be the first that could parse the phrase “I think therefore I am”. The birth of human’s defining trait. And this could have been a real brain reorganization in the same way that one cannot achieve certain meditative states without practice.It’s quite the leap to go from language models to an evolutionary path to the human condition, but I was having fun. A little harmless speculation, no matter if the loose ends. Imagine my surprise when I found one psychologist’s magnum opus argues that this precise sequence of events explains consciousness. The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind is, in my opinion, fatally flawed. He argued that the realization was 3,200 years ago, after the pyramids were constructed and writing was invented. Despite the date being almost universally rejected, many still find his mechanism begrudgingly compelling. The type of theory intellectuals keep around as a sparring partner. Something you should grapple with, even if you don’t take it as truth.

For me the idea being treated so seriously was a whiff of blood, and my reaction in these situations is to read. (DnD character class: nerd-berserker.) I read books about language and evolution: Breakdown of The Bicameral Mind, Descent of Man, The Recursive Mind, Chomsky, Don’t Sleep There Are Snakes, Immortality Key. I read dozens of papers about consciousness, recursion, bicameralism, snakes in mythology, the pharmacology of snake venom, the agricultural revolution, the evolution of language, behavioral modernity, linguistics, and the sapient paradox. 

Surprisingly, Genesis hit the hardest. The phenomenology was so close to what I imagined self-identification to be like. One would become as the gods, and by necessity be cast from their presence. The hallucinated parts of our mind would not have gone down without a fight even as we subsumed them. Then there would be the horror of the newly emptied interior, and the weight of agency forever on our shoulders. All artfully captured in the most famous story ever told. 

Well, what if we take the story by it’s own terms? It claims to be passed down from the beginning of time. What about the more mundane details? Those we can test! Genesis claims that snakes were involved, and women tasted knowledge first. Not only that, but agriculture was a result. That’s enough to work with!

## Anchoring the castle in the skySnakes, in fact, may be a surprisingly good pairing for a self-realization. Those who abuse their venom report experiences similar to more popular psychedelics like mushrooms. 

Besides the snakes, there are other details in Genesis. Women obtained knowledge first, and gave it to men. And agriculture was a result. So my little mind game had led me to a place where I was considering there being a Snake Cult of Consciousness circa 10,000 BC, where women inducted men into the human condition using snake venom. Fun, but almost certainly a castle in the sky, right? Right?

What’s weird is that the idea refuses to die. Gobekli Tepe is the invention of religion. End of the Sapient Paradox. At the time and place where we first transition to agriculture. And it’s a snake cult! Okay, lucky guess on the part of the Bible. Linguistics should settle this.

Well, if self-awareness was new, then maybe “I” was invented after humans left Africa. Surprisingly, most of the world’s proto-languages have a very similar form the 1sg. Has been debated for a century, and must be diffusion. Very strange indeed. Genetics will falsify it, right?

Men become self-aware 100% naturally these days. If the argument is that 12k years ago this was not the case, there must be some genetic change all across the world. Impossible! And yet, globally, 95% of all male lineages died out in the early to mid Holocene. This is absolutely bonkers and completely unexplained. 

As is the Agricultural revolution, for that matter. Nobody knows why agriculture popped up all over at roughly the same time. There is an entire “Sapient Paradox” which goes farther. We just don’t seem to live the full human life until suddenly, all over the world, we start producing art and civilization. Or as described by Eric Hoel

*It’s really only in the Upper Paleolithic (12,000-5,000 BC) that there is any good evidence for what we would call civilization, with its associated lavish burials and monumental centers of ritual congregation and pilgrimage and trade networks and specialization of tribes toward certain industries, and it is only at this point that complex representation in art becomes essentially universal.*Scott Alexander has assembled the largest group of pedants in history, and this claim was well received. Even Corballis, who argued we were 100% fully human 200kya, says the vanguard of humanity did not reach current hunter-gatherer level until 12kya. 

All of this is very strange, and I think connected. 12kya is well within the time frame that myths can survive, so we should expect whatever psychological (or cultural!) changes that produced Gobekli Tepe and Sapience (in the Sapience Paradox sense) to be part of our myths now.

But of course it is also highly speculative. One rationalist friend told me “2% chance this is true…you gotta go for it.”. And it’s true, this problem has withstood thousands of years of debate and I am not likely to move the needle. But I maintain that EToC will not remain speculation. It’s uniquely falsifiable as far as theories of consciousness go. For example, it predicts a sweep on cognition-related genes during the Y Chromosome bottleneck. That is, that there were certain genes on the Y Chromosome that disrupted self-awareness. This would hold in Australia or the Americas or Eurasia. When the Snake Cult entered these places, the same genes would be selected against. That’s not so hard to test!

Even without that data, there is already some pretty good evidence which I’ll discuss more in the next section

The distribution of pronouns is very hard to explain without diffusion after the Out of Africa event.

Why are snakes associated with creation and knowledge around the world?

What could cause the Y chromosome bottleneck? 

I’d like to think that this project has more than 2% chance of success. But even then, the upside indicates I should press on. And as for the downside, I’m learning about mythology, recursion, and philosophy. Hardly a waste, even if it turns out the Snake Cult doesn’t have legs.

So, that is my background. An engineer that cut their teeth in psychometrics, and a capable generalist able to learn on my own. Completely out of my depth in philosophy, but I’m not making any philosophical claims. Many philosophers have argued there is a deep connection between consciousness and language.

# ModelThe model is best digested hierarchically.

Broken

I’d like to continue writing about consciousness without linking people to hours of reading. There are also things I don’t like about earlier posts, but want to keep them up. I’ll take the liberty to edit this one to keep it up to date.

The most basic idea is that the best way to date the human condition is to look for evidence of the human condition. This is more radical than it sounds. For the people who we grant money to study the evolution of our species are at heart blank slatests who have no stomach to think critically about the evolution of our mind. They loudly decry phrenology on twitter but when asked when we became human they say “our skulls took their modern shape 170,000 years ago” and not “we started making art 40,000 years ago”.

Perhaps that is too harsh, we all peer through a glass darkly when looking this deep into the past. What I mean is that we should at least try to build an evolutionary model that matches the archeological data. I will let Michael Corballis sum up the archeological record. He put forth a model that we were 100% fully human 170,000 years ago, so bear in mind how inconvenient this data is for him.

*Homo sapiens emerged in Africa about halfway through the period known as the Middle Stone Age, which began around 300,000 years ago and ended around 50,000 years ago. Early sapiens may have been anatomically modern, but in terms of culture and technology was probably not greatly distinguishable from other large-brained members of the genus Homo. These included the Neandertals, who died out in Europe some 30,000 years ago, apparently eclipsed by the arrival, some 20,000 years earlier, of our own predatory species.**…***The African record prior to the exodus certainly suggests the beginnings of modernity, although the development of technology and cultural complexity seems relatively meager compared with what was to come in the Upper Paleolithic**, or Late Stone Age, which is generally reckoned to have ranged from some 40,000 years ago to 12,000 years ago.This second wave of innovation was most pronounced in Europe and western Asia, beginning roughly when Homo sapiens arrived there. The Upper Paleolithic marked nearly 30,000 years of almost constant change, **culminating in a level of modernity equivalent to that of many present-day indigenous peoples.** Technological advances included clothing, watercraft, heated shelters, refrigerated storage pits, and bows and arrows.This is what I think happened. The human condition requires self-awareness, which first emerged in Africa just before we left. In the beginning, it was sporadic. Perhaps limited to shamanic states, and women. For women have greater need of theory of mind and introspection; they show an advantage to this day. There were rituals which could induce self-awareness, at least temporarily. They would have been led by women and combined feasting, fasting, fucking, re-enacting stories, and eventually psychedelic drugs. This was perfected by ~15,000 years ago, and spread the world over. Those that could maintain self-awareness as a base state tended to survive. Now it is a natural part of our development, with or without a tortuous initiation ritual.

Such a fantastic story should clash with every channel of evidence, and yet it explains many mysteries. Why are pronouns so similar worldwide? Why was agriculture invented around the world at roughly the same time? Why is art so rare prior to 15kya? Why are creation stories so similar in their treatment of women, language and snakes?

Bringing the date of dispersal so near also includes an epistemic claim: that creation myths can help us understand the nature of the transition. 

It is also an epistemic argument. If consciousness is recent, then myths can help us understand that transition. It turns out they suggest a plausible mechanism and timeline.

# MechanismBefore consciousness we lived in the moment. There was no mind-body problem or place to ruminate about the past, future or imaginary realms. The inner voice was experienced the way any other sounds were, only it originated in our own head and was interpreted as a god. We did not identify with it. 

[Self-awareness produces recursion, which allows a bunch of other stuff]

Women became self-aware sometime around 50,000 years ago when we have evidence of recursion (counting, narrative art, self-portraits) as well as strong genetic selection on the X chromosome. This could have been gradual (thousands of years) and at first limited to shamanic experiences. As it is very deep in the past, lots of uncertainty.

Later, it was found that snake bites could induce a shamanic state of self-awareness. This idea was experimented on. Dosing, ritual, and anti-venom were all calibrated. The final version may have been a multi-day affair of feasting, fasting, fucking, dancing, torture (it is initiation, after all) and psychedelics. The full-fledged Ritual could consistently induce self-awareness for men as well. This went global ~15kya. This is quite recent, lots of evidence should survive since then.

Phenomenologically, this would have felt like rejecting the gods. Before, there had been a host of voices issuing commands. “I” displaced them but the gods would not have gone down without a fight. Especially in the beginning, when the self was not so smoothly constructed, it would have been leaving the sureness of unity with nature for the insanity of duality. The second birth would have been as traumatic as the first. This is why Eve and Pandora are maligned. They taught men to be like gods, *and that’s a bad thing*.Self-awareness requires recursion. What is aware of the self? Well, the self. Its own state becomes input to itself. This opened the doors to many other recursive thoughts: counting, mental-time travel, abstract thought, and full syntactic language. In the [words of Pinker and Jackendoff](https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/jackendoff/papers/FacultyofLanguage.pdf) *“Indeed, the only reason language needs to be recursive is because its function is to express recursive thoughts. If there were not any recursive thoughts, the means of expression would not need recursion either.”* # Sapient ParadoxThere was a worldwide behavioral revolution ~12,000 years ago. This is reflected in the name of our current epoch, The Holocene, meaning “wholly new”. Archeologists debate the extent, nature, and causal direction of the psychological changes that accompanied this. But everyone agrees there was an enormous cultural shift towards complexity and symbolic behavior.

**G**iven humans have been anatomically modern for 200k years, the Sapient Paradox asks why fully human behavior isn’t widespread until 12 kya? The [actual paper ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2606703/)is a bit softer, and discusses how strange it is that money and religion are invented so late in our history. [I argue that pronouns are admissible evidence in this debate.](https://vectors.substack.com/p/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of) The 1sg is a linguistic marker of self-awareness. It’s current distribution is most easily explained by global diffusion after the Out of Africa event. The Sapient Paradox may include sapience.This is in line with the classical position in anthropology is that behavioral modernity emerged [20-40k years ago](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335216046_Behavioral_Modernity_in_Retrospect).Several fields implicate recursion[^1] as the defining feature of human thought. If one adopts a high standard of recursion—self-portraits, narrative art, and counting—these are all evidenced only about 40kya.

We look through a glass darkly this far in the past. Things can’t be proved; I just want to demonstrate that, surprisingly, it is archeologically plausible to say that self-aware behavior only started after the great migration from Africa. Lots of experts make similar claims. I would not have guessed that before doing this study. To go a bit meta, it’s [acknowledged](https://youtu.be/Y3VBCWIDEzk?t=7124) that there is a strong post-war bias to push the date of humanness back as far back as possible. Hence lots of motivated thinking to argue almost-humans are all there, especially when communicating to the public.# Historicity of creation mythsSo we don’t know when we became fully human, but there was a big change in our behavior 12kya.

If there was a change in psychology 12kya, then myths can be used to understand the transition. Myths can definitely [last](https://theconversation.com/ancient-aboriginal-stories-preserve-history-of-a-rise-in-sea-level-36010) [that](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259193627_A_Cosmic_Hunt_in_the_Berber_sky_A_phylogenetic_reconstruction_of_Palaeolithic_mythology) [long](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64606-6_11).Genesis, like many creation myths, says:

Women were conscious first

Snakes were involved

Agriculture was a result

This seems likely, taking them in turn:

Women were conscious first

Women evolved for the social niche. At least while pregnant and with a young child, women are dependent on society. Hence why women [cry more easily](https://www.webmd.com/balance/why-we-cry-tearing-up), and do better on ToM tests. It’s important to note that this is only a comparative advantage. Men also evolved for the social niche, but were not quite so specialized there. Their ToM was more tuned to hunting, and thus representing animals. Thus if self-awareness came out of ToM for other humans, we should expect it to emerge first in women (if it is gendered).There is suggestive evidence of an early female advantage for recursion

Counting

Narrative art

Self-portraits: Art is a record of the minds that are on our mind. [Venus statues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurine) are made starting about 35,000 years ago. At this time, there is no complex surrounding the male form. Both sexes have a better model of their own mind. I think these statues were made by women, as they were becoming self-aware. Male figures do eventually emerge, but even then they tend to look like this (because the male ToM is tuned for hunting):

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Snakes were involved

[Snake venom can be used as a psychedelic.](https://vectors.substack.com/p/the-snake-cult-of-consciousness) The theory is that it was used in a ritual that somehow showed an initiate the concept of “I”.Myths also contain functional anti-venoms next to the snake, such as apples in the Garden of the Hesperides (guarded by Ladron). This is a [common](https://youtu.be/1nsk7KaIcm8?t=1282) [theme](https://www.academia.edu/1419559/The_Drink_and_the_Serpent_A_Comparative_Investigation_of_Two_Connected_Motifs_in_Scandinavian_and_Vedic_Mythologies) in Indo-European lore.Gobekli Tepe is crawling with snakes. Also made a type of beer that chemically functions as an antivenom. Once writing is invented one of the first things written down is that beer is an effective antivenom.

Quite common throughout the world: [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl), [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atum), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Serpent), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shesha), and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi). There have even been two books trying to explain the phenomenon.Cosmic Serpent. I say it’s diffusion 15k years ago. Goes a long way in explaining, for example, how the Rainbow Serpent creator deity spread over Australia just 6,000 years ago, despite the island being inhabited for 50,000 years. Sadly I am only the second most radical explanation of the snakes. It is very significant to him that he saw a snake while on Ayahuasca, and that two snakes intertwined make a double helix, just like DNA. Narby believes that snake deities exist and teach us knowledge, and that to explain snakes places in our myths, we must reject the scientific method. This has XX reviews and a 4.X rating on Goodreads.

evo-psych. More staid, but can’t explain the knowledge thing. One review says “great work, but why do you discount Jung”. Popular claim is that it is convergent evolution: snakes were our primary predators in our evolutionary past, and that burned itself into our psyche. That explains their commonness in our myths, but not why they are more often associated with creation and knowledge than death. Or why they are more common in creation myths than horror films.

Agriculture was a result

[Open mystery](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1323964111) why agriculture was invented at roughly the same time all around the world.Mental time travel (imagining the future) [requires self-awareness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661309000898). Inventing agriculture requires mental time travel (flexibly planning for the future). Therefore, self-awareness could produce agriculture.# GeneticsToM is part of gendered niche. Progress in Africa results in ToM so good women become self-aware. This is at least a dozen important new x-linked mutations.

We picked up a bunch of genes after leaving Africa. These include cognitive traits.

We then see massive selection on the X chromosome. This is protecting important homo-sapien X-linked ToM alelles. Keep the good, discard the bad.

In the Neolithic, we see massive selection on the Y chromosome

The party line is that none of this is any any way causal for the behavior changes we observe in the archeological record. That if anything it is the behavior changes that caused the selection. But different genes could not then cause different behavior. It is all about environment and culture.

buggered view of evolution. Even if you take the popular theories in their own terms they don’t make sense. If recursion evolved 100k or 50k years ago as many believe, then this is entering a whole new niche. When a species enters a new niche, there is fast adaptation (ie, non-trivial changes to genetic code). When we look at the human genome, this is exactly what we see. A bunch of new mutations (picked up from Neanderthals and others), and strong sex-based filters. Don’t see how that story can hold. [cut this, too hardcore]

There would have been massive genetic selection for those that could maintain recursive thoughts in order to have a stable sense of self. Gradually the success rate of The Ritual went up, as the recursive adepts had more children. The dosage of psychedelics could slowly be reduced. Mix and repeat until the required dosage falls to 0. Recursion now develops on its own. No need to chase the dragon.

Basically self-aware women were clever enough to change the environment in a way to speed up male evolution. Memes (The Ritual) imbued the ability for men to think (ie. host memes).  Eve tasted of the knowledge of good and evil. Seeing that it was good, she gave it to Adam. It’s a very human way to become as the gods.

As brainy apes, all Homo lineages had been evolving better Theory of Mind on their own. When Homo Sapiens left Africa, we crossed with Neanderthals and picked up some genes that were helpful for ToM. We know that something like this happened because many of the genes that code for cognition [only entered the human genome in the last 50,000 years](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.05.525539v1). In fact, it is [only in behavioral traits](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(17)30379-8) that we find Neanderthal mutations are more important than home-grown Homo Sapiens mutations[^2].  This is a big problem for those that say we were behaviorally modern before leaving Africa. On top of there being no archeological evidence for human staples like art, there is genetic evidence that we collected important genes by leaving the continent.After picking up some of these genes I think that women—but not men—could have recursive thoughts, including self-awareness. This was a super-power over their non-recursive competitors who could not: lie, invent, count, create art. Recursive women had more children and passed on their genes. If there were portions of the X chromosome which tended to disrupt recursion, they would be selected against. In fact there was  [“extraordinary” selection on the X-chromosome](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00034-4) at this time. The authors say this is the strongest selective pressure we know of, comparable to lactose tolerance after the domestication of animals.The evidence we have for recursion 40,000 years ago arguably all comes from women. Venus statues, counting sticks, cave art. I’m not saying that recursion was the base state, but it could clearly be reached sometimes. It’s very strange how few male representations there are from this time period. When there are males, they are combined with animals.

Eventually the Snake Cult of Consciousness is invented, perhaps coming into full form 12,000 years ago with Gobekli Tepe. In those rituals men are taught to be self-aware and in turn they have their own massive sex-based filter, the Neolithic Y chromosome bottleneck. 

There would have been massive genetic selection for those that could maintain recursive thoughts in order to have a stable sense of self. Gradually the success rate of The Ritual went up, as the recursive adepts had more children. The dosage of psychedelics could slowly be reduced. Mix and repeat until the required dosage falls to 0. Recursion now develops on its own. No need to chase the dragon. [pic of ouroboros]

# ConclusionFor simplicity, a strong version of the theory is described here. Undoubtedly there will be adjustments. But the core is:

Women were self-aware first

There was a psychological change 12,000 years ago

Creation myths can help us understand it

There was a ritual that helped imbue self-awareness. Snake venom was an active ingredient

This is an ambitious idea. Not only does it synthesize *Genesis* and Darwin, but the rest of the religions too. Big If True, I guess. So far the evidence I can point to is:Why are snakes so often associated with knowledge in creation myths?

Why are pronouns so similar worldwide?

Including the enigma of Australian language dispersal (that accompany initiation rites of the Rainbow Serpent)

Genetics

Extraordinary selection pressure on the X chromosome 50k years ago

Neolithic Y chromosome bottleneck

We picked up a lot of genes in the last 50k years, many affecting cognitive traits.

None of this selection effects cultural changes we see? Curious.

If recursion evolved from our ToM, why wouldn’t it first be observed in females?

counting, narrative art, and self-portraits all indicate it may have.

Solves the Sapient Paradox

Solves the Paradox of Schizophrenia

Answers why agriculture was independently invented at roughly the same time in the Fertile Crescent, Mexico, Peru, and China.

For me this is a search for truth. You can see the idea develop on this Substack from a throw-away theory relating gossip to evolution and the inner voice. I keep trying to falsify it and keep running into paradoxes explained easily by the Eve Theory of Consciousness. I’m surprised as anyone.

Other theories of our beginning ask us to believe that the base state of humans is to not be making art or telling stories or inventing technology, as per the Sapient Paradox. That we only experience the human condition because of nurture. What a dour view of humanity! Our inner life is the only thing that external forces [can’t take away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning).I say that the ancients were right. Women were conscious first, snakes were involved, and agriculture was the result. The materialists threw baby Jesus out with the bathwater.

Cut:

Keep in mind these events were not all that long ago! Well within the time period where myths can be informative. Aboriginal creation myth says the creators (often female) showed up, started time, taught them language and initiation rituals, and left. At least the language and religion part is corroborated by the expansion of the Rainbow Serpent religion and Pama-Nyguyen language family across Australia. Maybe it was right about subjective time as well. 

Or take the Greeks for example put this as the time that Demeter, the goddess of agriculture went around initiating men around the world into the Eluesinian mysteries. The mysteries Plato said held the whole world together.

[^1]: I will do a whole post on recursion, but for now know that recursive thinking is a super-power that a lot of people think is what makes us human. Technically, it is any process that calls itself as input. This is tautologically required for self-awareness: to be aware of itself, the self takes itself as input. It is also argued that recursion is required for language, counting, and imagining oneself in the future (or an imaginary narrative).

[^2]: “However, there are four phenotypes, all behavioral, to which Neanderthal alleles contribute more phenotypic variation than non-archaic alleles: chronotype, loneliness or isolation, frequency of unenthusiasm or disinterest in the last 2 weeks, and smoking status.”
