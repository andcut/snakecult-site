In a previous post I argued that if humans evolved along the axis of social cognition, and this is the secret to our success, then women must have been at the vanguard of this process. This is not so interesting if the process took millions of years, and therefore any group advantages would not be pronounced. But what if the nature of the human condition is a phase change. You either see it or you donâ€™t. Then there really would be an Eve.
