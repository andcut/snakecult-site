Psychologists sometimes treat personality structure as distinct from social desirability. This post shows that a majority information in Few Factor models is social desirability ‘bias’, and that’s fine.

[DeRaad dig on HeXACO for not being strictly lexical.] Same thing happens if we’d like to treat bias as different than neutral factors like emotional attachment. And it’s okay to not be completely Lexical; the models we use don’t have to reflect language. But it’s interesting to see where the LH breaks down.

EV of PC1 on personality and survey data. Show that the correlation matrix removes item bias. Even so, PC1 is ~25% of the variance. Without pearson corr, that number goes up to 80%. Show the same for NLP data. With z scoring the data PC1 is 40%. Without something like 80% again. De Baar has an excellent dig on HeXACO. “Yadda yadda it’s not truly Lexical because he throws out intelligence.” Something happens with social desirability. Language is gossip++. Value judgements are central (indeed, PC1) to the structure of character evaluations. If we want a value-less personality structure, we shouldn’t use the Lexical Hypothesis.

Minor points to hit:

  1. Bimodal (trimodal?) distribution of PC1 in NLP data

  2. As social creatures, this represents a fitness landscape. Survival of the friendliest.

  3. PC1 >> Agreeableness. Varimax rotation has hidden these insights.
