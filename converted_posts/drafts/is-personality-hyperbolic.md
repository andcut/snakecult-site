Explain that personality structure is simply the distribution of word vectors. We chose Euclidean geometry but there is plenty of work on hyperbolic word vectors. Hyperbolic geometry can be represented as hierarchical clustering tree. This is a more flexible way to think about how traits relate to each other. There was the decades-long debate about how to interpret correlations between alpha/GFP and the Big Five. These were usually interpreted as implying a hierarchy, when a rotation sufficed. Indeed, in Euclidean space what does a hierarchy look like? I guess it looks like a _bimodal_ distribution along some axis. Where each mode contains the same structure, but shifted along an important trait. This is what we observe when we reduce word vectors. Bimodal first PC. If this does imply a hierarchical structure, then we should be using hyperbolic space in the first place.
