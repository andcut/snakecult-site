**(TURIN PAPYRI, PLATE CXXXI)**

[58] From a papyrus of about the thirteenth century B.C., preserved in the museum at Turin. The text is edited by Pleyte and Rossi, _Papyrus de Turin_ , Plates CXXXI ff. (reprinted by Möller, _Hieratische Lesestücke_ , ii. Plates XXIX ff.); the first translation and correct mythological interpretation are due to E. Lefébure, in _A.Z._ xxi. 27 (1883). The original division into verses (indicated by dots of red ink in the papyrus) has been followed here, except in a few instances, although it does not always seem to agree with the rules for logical parallelism. The biting of the sun-god Atumu by some monster (Pyr. 425) does not seem to be analogous.

**Line**

(12) “Chapter of the divine god who arose by himself,

Who made the heaven, the earth, the air of life, and the fire,

The gods, the men, the wild animals, and the flocks,

The reptiles, the birds, and the fish,

The king of men and of gods together,

(13) (Whose) ages are more than (human?) years,” [59]

[59] We should expect “to whom an age means a year.”

Rich in names which people here know not,

Neither do those yonder know.

At that time [60] there was Isis, a woman

[60] This does not fit the preceding introduction; originally the connexion must have been different.

Skilful in sorcery(?), whose heart was tired

Of living forever [61] among men;

[61] Or, “the world of men” (Lefébure).

* * *

**(PLATE CXXXII)**

(1) She preferred time forever among the gods;

She esteemed (more highly) living forever among the illuminated spirits.

Was she not able [62] (to be) in heaven and on earth like Ré‘,

[62] _i.e._ , [she thought:] “Could she not be?” We have adopted Lefébure’s correction of the manuscript, which reads, “she was not able (to be).”

To become mistress of the land of gods? [63]

[63] Manuscript, “land (of the) goddess.” Möller (loc. cit.) proposed to divide, “mistress of the land. The goddess thought,” etc.; but this has the difficulty that, according to the story, Isis is not yet a goddess.

So she thought in her heart

(2) To learn the name of the holy god.

Now Ré‘ came every day

At the head of his followers, [64]

[64] Manuscript, “crew,” as though he were in his ship(?).

Established on the throne of both horizons.

The god had grown old; his mouth dripped,

(3) His spittle flowed to the earth,

His saliva fell on the ground.

Isis kneaded this with her hand

Together with the earth on which it was. [65]

[65] This is apparently the meaning, although the manuscript is mutilated at this point.

She formed it as a holy (4) serpent;

She made it in the form of a dart.

It did not wander alive before her;

She left it rolled together (?) on (?) the way [66]

[66] Or, “concealed on the way” (?) or, “blocking the way” (?). The word is mutilated in the text.

On which the great god wandered

At his heart’s desire over (5) his two countries. [67]

[67] _i.e._ , Egypt, not the entire world. In l. 2 and Plate CXXXIII, l. 1, the land of Egypt also seems to be meant, not the earth.

The holy god—life, welfare, health (to him)—appeared

(from) his palace,

The gods behind [68] following him.

[68] The italicized words seem to have been erroneously transposed in the manuscript.

He walked as every day.

(Then) the holy snake bit [69] him.

[69] Literally, “found his mouth.”

A living flame came forth from (6) himself [70]

[70] The sun-god, breathing heavily and painfully, emits his flames.

To drive away (?) the one in the cedars.” [71]

[71] Possibly an epithet of the sun-god. For the cosmic tree as a cedar see pp. 36, 115. After _emi_ , “being in,” the manuscript has an obscure and superfluous sign.

**SOME COSMIC AND COSMOGONIC MYTHS**

**Line**

The holy god opened his mouth.

The voice of His Majesty—life, welfare, health (to him)—reached heaven.

His circle of gods (said), ‘What is it?’

His gods (said), ‘What is the matter?’

(7) He found not a word [72] to answer to this (question).

[72] Correct the manuscript to _psh_.

His jaws trembled,

All his limbs shook,

The poison took possession of his flesh

As the Nile takes possession [73] over it.

[73] Omitted in the manuscript.

(8) The great god concentrated all his will-power. [74]

[74] Literally, “he established his heart.”

He cried to his followers:

“Come to me, ye who have arisen from my members,

Ye gods who have come forth from me,

That I may inform you what hath happened!” [75]

[75] Manuscript, “Khepri,” a meaningless reading, though of theological interest; cf. pp. 25, 68.

(9) Something painful hath pierced me

Which my heart had [not?] noticed,

And mine eyes had not seen,” [76]

[76] If the manuscript reading is correct, we should translate, “my heart hath (now) noticed it, (but) mine eyes have not seen it.”

Which my hand hath not made.

I know not who hath done all this.

I have not (ever) tasted such suffering;

No pain is stronger than this.

(10) I am the prince, the son of a prince,

The issue of a god which became a god;

I am the great one, the son of a great one.

My father hath thought out my name;

I am one with many names, with many forms.

(11) My form is in every god.

I am called Atumu and Har-hekenu.” [77]

[77] “The Horus of Praises,” _i.e._ , the praise-worthy (cf. Ch. V, Note 28).

My father and my mother (however) told me my (real) name;

It hath been hidden within me since (?) my birth

(12) In order that power and magic (force) [78] may not arise for one

[78] Or, “power (of) magic.”

who (may desire to) bewitch me.

I had come forth to see that which I (once) made,

I (began to) walk in the two countries which I created,

(13) When something pierced me which I know not.

Neither is it fire,

Nor is it water.” [79]

[79] This may also be read as a question: “Is it fire? Is it water?” See, however, the repetition below.

My heart is aglow,

My limbs tremble,

All my members shiver (14) with cold.

The children of the gods [80] should be brought to me,

[80] The younger generations of gods who form the transition to mankind (pp. 69, 120).

82 **EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY**

**Line**

Those wise of words,

Skilled with their mouth,

Who with their knowledge reach the firmament.’

* * *

**(PLATE CXXXIII)**

(1) There came the children of the god; each one

Was there with his lamentations.

There came (also) Isis with her wisdom,

The place of her mouth (full) of breath of life,

(With) her formule expelling suffering,

(With) her words (2) quickening those deprived of breath.

She said: ‘What is it? what is it, my divine father?

Hath a serpent spread pain (?) within thee?

Hath one of thy children lifted his head against thee?

Then I shall subject (3) it by excellent magic,

I shall drive it away at (?) the sight of thy rays.’

The majestic god opened his mouth:

‘I walked on the road,

I wandered in the two countries and the desert,

(4) (For) my face (?) [81] wished to see what I had created.

[81] We should expect, “my heart.”

(There) I was bitten by a serpent without seeing it.

It is not fire,

Nor is it water.

I feel colder than water,

I feel hotter than fire.

(5) All my limbs are sweating;

Mine eye trembleth and cannot be fixed;

Nor can I look upward.

A flood covereth my face like (the inundation) at the time of summer.’

(6) Isis said: ‘Tell me thy name, divine father!

The man will keep alive who is worshipped [82] by his (correct) name.’

[82] Alluding to the belief that a man’s personality and the memory of it live only as long as his name is in use.

(The sun-god replied):

‘I am the one who hath made heaven and earth, who hath raised [83] the mountains,

[83] Manuscript, _shed_ = old _ushed_ , a remarkable archaism.

And created what is upon it.’ [84]

[84] _i.e._ , on the earth. The mention of the mountains must have been different in the original form.

(7) I am the one who hath made the water which became the Great Flood,” [85]

[85] This may also refer to the sun-god, “who became (was formed) in the great flood.” For this Great Flood (_Meht-uér_) as the name of a goddess see p. 39, and for the sun-god as “bull of his mother” see p. 38.

Who made the Bull of his Mother,

Who became the wanderer (?). [86]

[86] The manuscript (perhaps correctly) understands this as “the one who created the first life.”

I am the one who made heaven as a secret and (its) two horizons,” [87]

[87] Or, referring the secrecy only to the horizon, “made the heaven and the secrets of the double horizon.”

In which I have placed the soul [88] of the gods.

[88] Literally, “the force.” It must be noted that all gods are here treated as manifestations of the same force (cf. p. 28 and Note 14).

(8) I am the one who (only) openeth his eyes, and there is light;

When his eyes close, darkness falleth.

The flood of the Nile riseth when he hath ordered it.

(9) The gods know not his name.

I am the one who made the hours so that the days came.

I am he who made the year begin and created the rivers.

I am he who made the living fire

(10) For producing works of smithcraft.” [89]

[89] Manuscript, “palaces” (?).

I am Khepri in the morning, Ré‘ at his standing still,” [90]

[90] _i.e._ , at noontime. On the different manifestations of the sun see pp. 27-28.

Atumu at evening time.’

The poison was not stopped as it went on;

The great god did not feel well.

(11) Isis said: ‘Thy name is not in the enumeration which thou hast made.

Tell it to me, and the poison will leave;

The man will live whose name is pronounced.’

(12) The fire burned like a flame;

It became more powerful than a melting stove in flame.

The Majesty of Ré‘ said:

‘I have been searched (too much) by Isis;

My name will come forth from my bosom into thy bosom.’

(13) The god hid himself from his gods;

His place was prepared in the ship (called) ‘Millions [of Years].’

In the moment in which (the name) had left (his) heart,

She (Isis) said to her son Horus:

‘I have bound him by a holy oath (14) that the [great?] god give up [to thee] his two eyes.’

[91] [The great god, his name was betrayed to Isis, great in magic, Leave, O spell; come forth from Ré‘!].”

[91] The last two verses do not seem to belong to the original poem, but to the application of the myth as a conjuration for a person bitten by a snake.

* * *

The last two verses do not seem to belong to the original poem, but to the application of the myth as a conjuration for a person bitten by a snake. The story, the papyrus explains, is to be written twice, one copy to be wrapped around the neck of the patient, and the other to be washed off and drunk by him in beer or wine, according to a custom to be described in the chapter on magic (p. 199).

**84 EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY**

This myth, which is as remarkable for its poetry as for its theology, seems to date from the beginning of the New Empire, since its pantheistic views scarcely admit of a period more remote. The story shows in good logical connexion the ancient Asiatic astral myth associating the constellations Virgo, Hydra, and Orion (=the sun) which we shall find again in our chapter on foreign influences; and it gives another version of the legend which precedes it, answering the question why the gods dwell no more on earth: a serpent caused the sun-god to withdraw to higher spheres. Its relation to the series of myths which we have considered in II and III is not yet clear; the incoherence and the language of that collection give the impression that its legends belong to an older epoch than the papyrus. For an earlier Egyptian idea which prepared the way for the legend of Isis and the sun-god see p. 25 and the myth of the lost eye of the solar deity (pp. 86-88).
