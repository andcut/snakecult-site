JJ believes multicultural traders were important in disseminating the new theory of mind. I believe Genesis is our best description of our conversion to this new theory. Both implicate Jews. 

Those telling the story understood the gravity of consciousness.

Starting with the patriarchs, they were going back and forth between the two most sophisticated civilizations. Maybe best way to have an epiphany about theory of mind. Destruction of gammorah dates abraham to 1600 BC https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/destruction-of-city-by-space-rock-may-have-inspired-biblical-story-of-sodom-180978734/

200 years later, egypt tries monotheism with Aten (king: Akhenetan). At around the time this fails, Moses leaves Egypt. Bible describes his people as slaves and many plagues visiting the egyptians. Egyptian version describes [Osarseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osarseph), a priest probably connected to Akhenetan, overseeing the creation of a pyramid with the help of 80k leper slaves. He then revolts. Synthesis of these two stories would be that, at a time of plague, Moses/Osarseph, a priest of Aten, stages an uprising and is forced out. First thing he does is establish the ten commandments, even though his followers weren’t particularly monotheistic.

Ten commandments are an almost perfectly fit meme. One question is why there are no idols.

Jonathan says one Jewish prayer is “thank you god for not allowing our neighbors (enemies) to know that we don’t believe in their gods”

Jews have always been hated. Is it because they had the ultimate red pill which could annihilate a cultures memes? This is a good place to look for the question: https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199840731/obo-9780199840731-0140.xml

Jesus starts his ministry ‘I am that I am’. Or, I am the self-existent one. I would render it “I am the collective conscience you dwelt with in eden. the same that issued the 10 commandments”. Then gives roughly a perfect sermon. He includes discussion about Jewish specialness “salt of the earth”. Implying, that what he was saying was what they forgot. They had forgotten about their special relationship with the voice. Includes the injuction not to cast pearls before swine. Understands that their knowledge doesn’t make them friends.

Ends his ministry with a line that JJ lifts: At another point in his book, Jaynes describes the soldiers of the Trojan war as being “...not at all like us. They were noble automatons who knew not what they did”

How long can a story last? https://www.treehugger.com/australian-aboriginal-tale-might-be-oldest-story-ever-told-4859391#:~:text=New%20volcanic%20evidence%20suggests%20that,gave%20life%20to%20the%20continent.

Eminent disciple of Aristotle, Theophrastus describes the Jews:

“being philosophers by origin, they converse with each other about the deity (the Divine), and at nighttime they make observations of the stars, gazing at them and calling on God by prayer.” Circa 300BC

That’s not how they would describe it, for god had long stopped speaking.

> _He has walled me in so I cannot escape;  
>  he has weighed me down with chains.  
> Even when I call out or cry for help,  
>  he shuts out my prayer._

How meager are modern times are for a species that can hear the echos of the divine.
