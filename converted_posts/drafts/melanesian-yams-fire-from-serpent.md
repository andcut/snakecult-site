Another excellent snake story: https://archive.org/stream/oceanicmythology0009dixo/oceanicmythology0009dixo_djvu.txt

`The daughter of Ulimgau went into the forest. The serpent saw her, and said, “Come!” and the woman replied, “‘Who would have you for a husband? You area serpent. I will not marry you.” But he replied, ““My body is indeed that of a serpent, but my speech is that of aman. Come!” And the woman went and married . him, and after a time she bore a boy and a girl, and her serpent husband put her away, and said, “Go, I will take care of them and give them food.” And the serpent fed the children and they grew. And one day they were hungry, and the serpent said to them, “Do you go and catch fish.” And they caught fish and brought them to their father. And he said, “Cook the fish.” And they replied, ““The sun has not yet risen.” By and by the sun rose and warmed the fish with its rays, and they ate the food still raw and bloody. Then the serpent said to them, “You two are spirits, for you eat your food raw. Per- haps you will eat me. You, girl, stay; and you, boy, crawl into my belly.” And the boy was afraid and said, “What shall I do?” But his father said to him, “Go,” and he crept into the serpent’s belly. And the serpent said to him, “Take the fire and bring it out to your sister. Come out and gather coco-nuts and yams and taro and bananas.” So the boy crept out again, bringing the fire from the belly of the serpent. And then hav- ing brought the food, the boy and girl lit a fire with the brand which the boy had secured and cooked the food. And when they had eaten, the serpent said to them, “Is my kind of food or your kind of food the better?”” And they answered, “Your food is good, ours is bad.” `

Note that Demeter is said to have spread her snake cult + agriculture.
