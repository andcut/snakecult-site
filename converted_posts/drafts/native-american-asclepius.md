The mythology of native North America

https://archive.org/details/mythologyofnativ00leem/page/88/mode/2up?q=serpent

> Yuchi-Creek: In the Beginning
> 
> In the beginning water was everywhere, and the question was asked, “Who will make land?”
> 
> Crawfish dove down to the bottom and found mud there. He stirred it up and took some away, but this made the mud people angry. "Who is stirring up our mud?" they demanded. But Crawfish moved so fast and stirred up so much mud that the mud people could never catch him. He kept bringing mud up from below, making more and more land.
> 
> The land needed to be dried out, so finally Buzzard soared over it, and when he flapped his wings he stirred up mountains and valleys. But it was dark in this place, so Star gave some light. It wasn't enough light, so Moon added his, but this still wasn't enough. Finally, Great Mother then said she would make light enough for the world, and she began her daily journey across the sky. A drop of her blood fell to the earth and gave birth to the first people, the Yuchi, the children of the sun.
> 
> After a while a great serpent began to bother the Yuchi. They cut off its head, but right away it grew back. They cut it off again, and again it grew back. So this time they cut it off and put the head in a tree. The next day they found that the tree was dead and the head had grown back together with the serpent's body. They kept trying this, putting the head in different kinds of trees, but the result was always the same until they put the head in a cedar tree. Then the monster died. So the Yuchi found their big medicine.
> 
> Before long they learned about fire, and got their own language, and were happy.
