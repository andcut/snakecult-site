First article argued PFP is special for statistical reasons. The first eigenvalue is 8x that of the fifth. It rivals g in external validity. It can be recovered almost exactly with word vectors or surveys. Indeed, the signal is so dominant that a similar factor appears on questionnaires with quite different content. Language models and people seem to process PFP loading involuntarily. No other personality construct has such convergent evidence. There is no reason to believe it is a statistical artifact.

Second post made a theoretical argument for PFP. For a species dependent on society, it is fit to conform, engage in politics, and behave altruistically. Today, we navigate societal demands with the help of our inner voice. I suggest this may have started soon after we developed outer speech roughly 50k years ago. Internal dialogue increased our ability to navigate morality and permeated many parts of our cognition, including memory and our concept of self. Could inner speech be part of the story of art, gods, and our conquest of all dumb beasts?

Third post made claims about gender differences in the path to consciousness. Women heard voices first, and learned to navigate them first. I also suspect that agriculture followed this awakening, as women had increased ability to worry and plan about the future. The different paths potentially explain gender differences at the clinical (schizophrenia, anxiety/depression, sociopathy) and general level (emotional intelligence, auditory hallucinations, religiosity, verbal tilt in intelligence). This is not just a list of gender differences. This is a list of gender differences wrought by gendered paths to consciousness. An idea synthesized on this blog.

**Claim:** The cornerstone of any personality model must be the primary factor of personality, or the Golden Rule. All other traits must have a clearly defined relationship to it (be that hierarchical or orthogonal or correlated). Further, there exists such a model that is substantially more explanatory, descriptive, predictive, culturally universal, and parsimonious than the Big Five. # Nature at it’s joints*“Lexical analyses and dimensionality-reduction methods are tools to explore rough contours of the personality space. We should not, however, delude ourselves into thinking that we are slicing nature at its joints to discover a “true” structure of personality.” ~Wiernik, et al*Language is central to our evolution, cognition, and the derivation of psychometric models. As such, it would be shocking if lexical models of personality are merely descriptive where any rotation will do. Some rotations align with natures joints. Others do not.

Indeed, Saucier connects the Big Two to four different theoretical systems. The reason this doesn’t work with the Big Five is they don’t find the joints.

[self-supervision and general personality. Has to use Meta-traits. Also, the interpretation of social self-regulation is about extraversion. Good question asked, but both scales obscure the answer. psychometrics 0/2.]

# A theory conspiracymcrae via mottus

# Mind Vector ManifestoI want it well known that

The Big Five was established via a conspiracy

Personality science has maintained two fundamental and contradictory positions for decades

The PFP is a statistical artifact

But it’s valid to spread it from PC1 to the minor factors in order to create the Big Five

A popular position in personality psychology is that no model will cut nature at its joints

I think that the PFP is implicated in the birth of consciousness. If the 21st century psychologist tends to explain too little, this errs in the other direction. But at least it puts up a theory that can be tested!

# unplaced text:As an interloper, it could be that I simply miss the mark. These issues have been discussed since the 19th century; there is a lot of material to cover. But I suspect at least part of the problem is gatekeeping and a closed informational system. As I’m not an academic but am read by them, this blog is in a good position to cry “tear down this wall!” Please share this series if you think there’s something to it.

Uses of a general personality model are not so different as to justify models optimized for explanation, description, and prediction separately. And indeed, models that are explanatory will be descriptive and predictive by virtue of cutting nature at it’s joints.

My career security comes from making number go up in alzheimers and concussion prediction, as such it doesn’t matter much if I’m right about obscure psychometric questions. It’s a completely separate status game! As such, I have more leeway to press the issue.

# Epistemic statusOne thing the rationalists get right is to [rate claims by epistemic status](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Hrm59GdN2yDPWbtrd/feature-idea-epistemic-status). This is better than the norm in academia: to make mostly safe claims to get by reviewers. Progress goes faster when we articulate ideas that *may* be true.### Equivalence of ‘general’ factorsEven without introducing new data, I’m actually quite confident that GFP is roughly equivalent to p and g-PD. There are many range restriction problems, the best way to solve them would be to literally take questions from p and g-PD and include them in the measure of general personality.

range restriction problems are real though. We spend more time justifying speaking too loud or hitting someone (totally innocuous if it’s an accident) than why we killed our father. Hence FFP loading more on being rude than patricidal. This is influenced by what words count as general. Using 2918 words, most of the top 30 have to do with politeness. Using Allport’s 18k words, the first factor instead loads on extreme bad behavior. Screeching, megalomaniacle, etc. Those word lists are in the footnotes here and here. It’s okay to try and make theoretical contributions like this before we have settled on the ‘best’ lexical model. 

I also want to note that different choices about what NLP data to consider produces different FFP. Above I embed a small list of 100 basic personality adjectives translated into 7 languages using a multilingual language model (XLM-RoBERTa). 

### FFP is not generaldepends on the definition of general. If general means that it captures something related to all parts of personality, then I don’t think so. FFP ex uncorrelated with extraversion or time preference. 

### FFP is hierarchically related to general personalityHere general personality means a multiple factor model that can describe normal variation. Medium. Problem is multiple definitions of hierarchically. I think that words, and people, exist first on FFP, then can distinguish themselves at finer levels.

### Beta is not hierarchically related to the Big Fivehigh. Beta or PC2 is largely unaffected by varimax rotation, at least with 5 factors. Like all but the first factor, it is normally distributed.

### FFP cuts nature at its jointsHigh. The nature of language is explanatory, we tell stories when we describe. Further, language records the direction social pressure. This was important in our evolution towards humanity. Finally, GFP is used when personality psychologists look for causal mechanisms.

# ConclusionSoft case was initially made for the Big Five in “close no doors”.

> “The danger with Pervin's critique [of the Big Five] is that it might prove divisive and close some doors, rather than emphasize our common goals”

Ironically, with the adoption of Big Five, lexical analysis was largely abandoned. Why did researchers who had item and word data, who knew the nature of the Big Two could only be resolved using that, instead use derivative *aspects*? As an outsider, my guess is that once the Big Five was adopted, none of the big players wanted to return to the debate of general personality structure. The field had successfully exported the model, why rock the boat? This makes sense if one believes that only a descriptive framework is possible. Enter incremental science where it is delusional to believe a model can slice nature at it’s joints.In this post I started by doing what Ashton suggested with Alpha and Beta: go back to the item-level data. Found that alpha is simply the first principal component of lexical data, which can be reproduced with high fidelity using NLP. This answers the two persistent questions about the GFP. Is it an artifact? No. How is it related to the Big Five? It is the first unrotated factor of the data on which the Big Five were based. 

General, indeed oversells this factor. At least 3 factors are required to build a *general* model of personality. Primary is a more appropriate name. It is of chief importance; we can’t help but process social desirability even when asked about other traits. This has implications for how we measure personality. The invention of language changed the fitness landscape. Since Darwin, our appreciation of cultural evolution has increased. Heinrich and preserving knowledge, moralizing gods. Writing is new. We evolved along PFP more than g. 

I believe social pressures made an inner voice fit. There are various words for our inner monologue that answers to society. Inner monologue, conscience, still small voice. It is usually about correcting our impulses to conform to social mores. Coming from the other direction, Elephant in Brain emphasizes its role in rationalizing personal desires to the group. Psychology may have the worst conceptualization with social self-monitoring, extraversion by another name.

Psychology is hobbled by its instruments. Understanding the genesis of the Big Five allows us to answer how PFP relates to the Big Five, as well as whether it is an artifact. Mired for decades debating these basic facts, researchers could not ask the more interesting questions raised in the second half of this blog. When they were, as with the connection between social self-monitoring and general personality, poor instruments once again shrouded the connection. 

There is a tradeoff between probing constructs, and measuring people on those constructs. Many choices about how to represent constructs are made in order to build an instrument. These are not essential to the construct, however in the quantitative regime, once an instrument is designed, this is primary way to ask questions about the construct. How can you measure a construct without scoring a bunch of people?

Language is a way out, as I have argued in In the Beginning Was the Word. We can locate specific constructs in personality space by the location of the word vectors. No subjects are needed. In the case of PFP, the construct is simply the first PC. Because we know the function of language, this offered theoretical insight about what it is. [We expect pfp to be social self-regulation because language is gossip ++. Qualitatively, that is a very good description of the word loadings.] This explains some of the curious aspects of GFP in surveys. It’s general, in the sense that it always appears. Humans, a social species, cannot help but evaluate and respond to social approval. This is not just response bias, as some claim. The PFP is the vector of social pressure along which we evolved. 

## What to do about joints?Good chefs know the importance of maintaining sharp knives in the kitchen. What’s their secret? A well-worn Taoist allegory offers some advice. The king asks about his butcher ’ s impressive knife-work. “Ordinary butchers,” he replies “hack their way through the animal. Thus their knife always needs sharpening. My father taught me the Taoist way. I merely lay the knife by the natural openings and let it find its own way through. Thus it never needs sharpening.” Plato famously employed this “ carving” metaphor as an analogy for the reality of Forms: like an animal, the world comes to us predivided. Ideally, our best theories will be those which “carve nature at its joints.” Slater and Broghini, [Carving nature at it’s joint](https://philarchive.org/archive/SLAILF#:~:text=Plato%20famously%20employed%20this%20%E2%80%9C%20carving,carve%20nature%20at%20its%20joints.%20%E2%80%9D)s[As a footnote: Nature at joints means there are natural kinds. Personality researchers don’t believe in types so I assume the authors meant something softer. I do think that personality has causes, and PFP lines up with both natural selection and personal social development. There is no important cause so nearly captured by a Big Five factor.] 

This post seeks to explain a great deal. To the extent that it succeeds, it is because nature has joints and lexical analysis finds them. The quote disparaging such models argues that the number of factors and their rotation doesn’t really matter. Models have different purposes, and we can’t hope to find a general one much better than the Big Five (or Three or HEXACO). We have been debating this for a century, the thinking goes, there are still rocks unturned? **If the claims in this post hold up, yes. Which means** **reducing lexical data is back on the table and general structure is up for debate.**The PFP is the most important factor of human nature. It’s not a statistical artifact. It plays a dominant role in our individual development, as well as that of our species. The Big Five obscures this by shuffling PFP variance onto factors an order of magnitude less important.

Many thanks to alex, derin, jonathan, who helped with BLAH BLAH. I am currently looking for a personality researcher who is fluent in non-European languages. Let me know if you’d like to collaborate. Always looking for feedback and different perspectives; leave a comment. Please share to any of your friends taken in by Big Big Five. There’s still hope for them!

This post seeks to unify p, g-PD, alpha, stability and GFP under a lexical framework. I argue the shared signal overcomes very different modes of data collection: natural language vs surveys, participants in psychology departments vs psych wards, Big Five Inventory vs surveys of drug abuse, PCA vs Bifactor models. Further, the lexical connections offers a host of rich theoretical interpretations from evolution to consciousness: what it means to be human. This is what it looks like to cut nature at its joints. 

In the parlance of tech twitter, there is still alpha in Alpha. Psychology focused too much on factors that were optimized for scoring individuals, not describing the constructs. Interstitial space was ignored. Simple structure was confused for hierarchy. Data was largely from small samples of WEIRD undergrads. It wasn’t appreciated that the Big Five are simply varimax rotated word vectors.

Now we have terabytes of natural language data from all over the world. We have the compute, models, and method to translate that to personality structure [link to me and david]. We have open science, and we have a more diverse set of voices. The time is ripe for another round of the long debate. Keep reading the blog for front row seats. (And share to get me to keep writing these, plenty more are half done.)
