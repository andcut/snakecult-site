My 13th great grandfather, Royal James Cutler, was the first constable of Cambridge Farms, Massachussettes (now Watertown). He was a puritan who came to America because he would rather uproot his entire life than feign Catholic (Anglican?) faith. 150 years later, his descendants lived in Upstate New York, and were among the first converts to Mormonism. At the same time, many of my ancestors in Europe heard the Mormons were building Zion in the desert across the Atlantic and left everything to prepare for the second coming of Christ. Story of sailpin, with photo.

Having been a missionary in Upstate New York for two years, I can attest that it would be easier to sell a beach house in Idaho than Zion in Utah. And yet, many of my ancestors bought just that. For some women, the Utopia turned out to be managing a ranch in a dusty settlement as Brigham Young’s 30th wife. (Highly recommend Daughters of Pioneers Museum in SLC. Delightfully odd, it’s where we stash the weird stuff.)

Mormons are a double-distillation of religious impulses, dreaming, and credulity. Perhaps it’s not _just_ the high-trust culture that makes us the MLM capital of America. If we’ve learned one thing from behavior genetics it’s that disposition is quite heritable.

It’s difficult to say exactly, because disposition is hard to measure. You can administer a survey that asks “how likely are you to believe a charming missionary when he asks you to come home with him to build Zion”? In the case of Mormons, there is no need. We are the Gold Standard. Those who put their shoulder to the wheel and ended up in Salt Lake City.

Populated by fecund idealists yearning for meaning, our lovely Deseret[link to song] will always be weird. Even if the next batch of Utahns was snatched up at birth and raised in another culture, they would still need to scratch the eschatological itch.

My ancestors came for predominantly religious reasons, but the Americas were also (de)populated by conquistadores and economic migrants. Explain how insane Cortez was. Gambler and womanizer, already has a nice life after conquering in the caribbean. Very competent, will be sent out to gather intel on aztecs. Governor realizes that Cortez cannot be trusted to just gather intel, stops the mission. Cortez pulls the trigger and leaves two days later, knowing this is punishable by death. He would conquer the Aztecs or die trying. So he left with 500 people to take down an empire of 25 million. In genetics there are founder effects. Those at the beginning of outsized genetic influence. These are the founders of the New World.

New Worlders, as a whole, must be more prone to start a fist fight / company / religion than those they left behind in the Old World. We can’t help it, and the rest of the world can’t help but watch.

In the USA there are many Europhiles who wished we could get our shit together like the Nordic countries. To them I say, good luck! A full 1/3 of all Swedes left during the potato famine. Those that stayed are docile. We are the huddled masses with cold feet, hand to God, armed to the teeth.

This post very similar to Albion’s Seed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion%27s_Seed

Epistemic status: eh who knows. Writing because I’d like to hear the case against group differences for a highly selected group like Mormons or a modestly selected group like Americans. FWIW Australia was a giant prison but their crime rate is on par with the UK.
