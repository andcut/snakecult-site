Zizek says that, for an atheist, the final experience with god is bureaucracy

*What can be more “divine” than the traumatic encounter with the bureaucracy at its craziest when, say, a bureaucrat tells me that, legally, I don’t exist? It is in such encounters that we get a glimpse of another order beyond mere earthly everyday reality. Like God, bureaucracy is simultaneously all powerful and impenetrable, capricious, omnipresent and invisible.*This is the awe Yossarian feels when he learns about Catch 22. He could leave the war if he was crazy, but only if he applied to leave. This of course would prove he was sane. *“That’s some catch” *he admires. I feel the same way about Yahweh, the perfect meme.Once memes came onto the scene, it is not clear if memes or genes were at the helm. A fit meme, like jihad, can slice through bones and melt steel beams. In a very real sense, there are ideas exerting their force on the physical world. They are more powerful than you or I, and they compete with one another.

For our purposes, we will cover two types of memes. One is rules such as “we should collectively kill people who commit adultery”. The other is the gods themselves, such as Zeus or Shiva.

# Norms as memesFor biological reasons, both males and females have both long short term dating strategies. For women, it is in their interest to insure commitment and material resources. If they are to carry a child and then nurse it, they will need more calories than usual and be less able to secure those themselves. Their child will be healthier the longer that commitment lasts. The child’s health is also determined by the quality of the father’s genes, so it makes sense for women to also seek a non-committed sperm donor of very high quality.

It is also fit for men to have healthy, well-provided offspring that will grow up and reproduce. Hence men also have the same long-term mating strategy. Their short-term mating strategy is different, however. As they don’t become pregnant or nurse, the cost is much less for a man. His short-term strategy is to spread his seed far and wide, avoiding commitment.

In a mating market where everyone has these strategies open to them, social “asks” will be made in many directions. *He stole my woman. My man left me after I didn’t give him a son. She cheated on me. *Game theory will determine which memes survive when they enter the arena of everyday life. Over time society will come up with scripts on how to respond to such claims. Society will rank the memes, and the fittest will rise to the top.This relies on the idea that it is not just might that makes right. This is obviously true, even in war. After Alexander the Great died his empire was chopped up. In one battle his aged mother, Olympias, marched into the battle field, rips her dress, beats her chest and asks if these Macedonians dare defy the mother of Alexander. This worked!

Of course moral claims are also modulated by power. In patriarchal societies there is a double standard on this issue. But even that may not be a simple power dynamic: from an evolutionary point of view, siring a bastard is less of a threat to the goal of a pair-bond (producing healthy offspring) than being cuckolded. And men’s ability to exchange money for harams was curtailed (by other men), even in societies that privilege powerful men.

# Gods as memesZeus is another form of meme. He is animated by the ancient Greek’s shared belief in his power

I have argued that consciousness was a consequence of conscience, that the ground on which memes grow is new and built on top of the super-ego. In this view, monotheism is an enormous simplification of this system. There are many asks of us from many different parties. Over millennia, the edges of these asks were hewn down by game theory. If you are going to make a moral claim, it should be symmetric; eventually someone can use it against you.

go through all of God’s names showing that they fit the bicameral theory.

Gods are memes. Social demands experienced as occasional auditory hallucinations. Each individual’s gods tend to agree because we have good theory of mind and people have similar needs. “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.” We would also discuss the demands with each other and mutually modify our god based on feedback. 

If I were a god, why not take all of the best ideas everyone agrees on, then add one more: kill all the other gods. With that strategy in mind, consider the ten commandments

Thou hast no other Gods before Me.

Thou dost not make to thyself a graven image, or any likeness which [is] in the heavens above, or which [is] in the earth beneath, or which [is] in the waters under the earth. Thou dost not bow thyself to them, nor serve them: for I, Jehovah thy God, [am] a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on the third [generation], and on the fourth, of those hating Me, and doing kindness to thousands, of those loving Me and keeping My commands.

Thou dost not take up the name of Jehovah thy God for a vain thing, for Jehovah acquitteth not him who taketh up His name for a vain thing.

Remember the Sabbath-day to sanctify it; six days thou dost labour, and hast done all thy work, and the seventh day [is] a Sabbath to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and thy cattle, and thy sojourner who is within thy gates, --for six days hath Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and resteth in the seventh day; therefore hath Jehovah blessed the Sabbath-day, and doth sanctify it.Honour thy father and thy mother, so that thy days are prolonged on the ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee.

Thou dost not murder.

Thou dost not commit adultery.

Thou dost not steal.

Thou dost not answer against thy neighbour a false testimony.

Thou dost not desire the house of thy neighbour, thou dost not desire the wife of thy neighbour, or his man-servant, or his handmaid, or his ox, or his ass, or anything which [is] thy neighbour's.
