[This post draws from two theories for the development human intelligence. The social intelligence and hunting hypothesis. It seems that one was more important for men, and the other for women. Possible genetic architecture as well.]

Once humans developed a sufficiently advanced theory of mind, this was expressed as art designed to arouse the symbolic representations stored in their heads. Women, courting auditory hallucinations of her idealized peer, crafted Venus statues. Men, endowed with worse language skills but more visual acuity, animated animals to aide in the hunt. The medium is the message; each sex fashioned a form fit for information they desired to receive.

On the subject of prehistoric art Steven Mithen [writes](https://humanjourney.us/ideas-that-shaped-our-modern-world-section/paleolithic-beginnings/#:~:text=By%20about%2030%2C000%E2%80%9340%2C000%20years,the%20world%20we%20know%20today.), _“This art was part of modern human ecological adaptation to their environment. The art functioned to extend human memory, to hold concepts which are difficult for minds to grasp, and to instigate creative thinking about the solution of environmental and social problems.”_ The Human Journey project [adds](https://humanjourney.us/ideas-that-shaped-our-modern-world-section/paleolithic-beginnings/#:~:text=By%20about%2030%2C000%E2%80%9340%2C000%20years,the%20world%20we%20know%20today.):

> _By about 30,000–40,000 years ago the capacity for abstract thought and symbolic representation finally became a stable and universal capacity of the human mind and one of the universal traits that we share with all other humans. It enabled us to communicate in an unprecedented way, and build the world we know today. We were the same human beings then as we are now._

Such histories usually remind the reader that they are the same as these ancient artists. The bicameral theory of mind claims we are profoundly different. That what you think of consciousness—certainly the ability to ruminate—is a fairly new skill. That these early humans experienced their models of other minds as hallucinations from the gods. 

This post tries to explain the first art using a bicameral framing. Early art is consistent because it filled a useful cognitive niche in our psychological toolkit. The two sexes differed in the problems they needed solved as well as their perceptual strengths. This resulted in men making cave art of predominantly animals, and women making Venus Statues.

## Hit or nah?


[note that it’s funny everyone who writes on the subject has to reassure you there have been no cognitive adaptations among humans since 30k years ago. Once we acquired the capacity for abstract thought, the fitness landscape plateaued—Darwinian forces were vanquished. Nazi historian X shares no such scruples and in his interview with Lex Friedman presses the issue about how far back one would take a wife. His way of getting at when we became a fully modern human. I guess if you have Holocaust museums dedicated to you they let you do it.]

## Venus statues


“Women have higher rates of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) than men” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5623384/

> “Venus figurines date from between about 40,000 BCE and 10,000 BCE…The most common material used to carve these statuettes is mammoth tusk, but teeth, antlers, bone, and stone were also used. … The figures are usually voluptuous female nudes. Some of their features, such as their breasts, hips, stomachs and pubic areas, are greatly exaggerated while other characteristics are absent or downplayed. …Given that the creators of these carvings were separated by 30,000 years and hundreds of kilometers, it is remarkable that so many of them share the same traits.” https://www.worldhistory.org/Venus_Figurine/

Basically a high status woman, who these women wanted to be, and had to play nice with.

Women are much better at reading women’s minds: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01324/full

Male schizos hear almost no female voices: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8492592/

Seems pretty cut and dry.

## Cave art


> **cave art** , generally, the numerous [paintings](https://www.britannica.com/art/painting) and [engravings](https://www.britannica.com/art/engraving) found in caves and shelters dating back to the [Ice Age](https://www.britannica.com/science/ice-age-geology) (Upper [Paleolithic](https://www.britannica.com/event/Paleolithic-Period)), roughly between 40,000 and 14,000 years ago. 
> 
> Representations in caves, painted or otherwise, include few humans, but sometimes human heads or genitalia appear in isolation. Hand stencils and handprints are characteristic of the earlier periods, as in the [Gargas](https://www.britannica.com/place/Gargas) cave in the French Pyrenees. Animal figures always [constitute](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitute) the majority of images in caves from all periods. During the earliest millennia when cave art was first being made, the species most often represented, as in the [Chauvet–Pont-d’Arc](https://www.britannica.com/place/Chauvet-Pont-dArc) cave in France, were the most-formidable ones, now long extinct—cave lions, [mammoths](https://www.britannica.com/animal/mammoth-extinct-mammal), [woolly rhinoceroses](https://www.britannica.com/animal/woolly-rhinoceros), [cave bears](https://www.britannica.com/animal/cave-bear). Later on, [horses](https://www.britannica.com/animal/horse), [bison](https://www.britannica.com/animal/bison), [aurochs](https://www.britannica.com/animal/aurochs), [cervids](https://www.britannica.com/animal/deer), and [ibex](https://www.britannica.com/animal/ibex) became prevalent, as in the [Lascaux](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lascaux) and [Niaux](https://www.britannica.com/place/Niaux) caves. Birds and fish were rarely depicted.

We were selected to think like hunters. Including the ability to anticipate the action of prey. Theory of mind for those we hunted. Could we have started hallucinating their minds?

Excellent description by H. Clark Barrett in the Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology

> Hunting is likely to have shaped our lineage in diverse ways. As was the case for predation, the many ways in which a reliance on hunting might have shaped our bodies and minds is not intuitively obvious. According to Kaplan and colleagues, for example, accelerating reliance on hunting in the human lineage had multiple cascading effects on ourlife histories, social organization, and cognition (Kaplan et al., 2000). They suggest that the shift to meat, as well as other nutritionally dense and hard-to-process food sources, created a cascading, self-reinforcing coevolutionary process. Meat as a food source allows humans to grow large brains, which, in turn, improves our ability to hunt, as well as to cooperate. Increasingly long life histories are selected for because of the benefits of skill acquisition, as well as resource transfers across generations: up to three generations, in humans, which is rare among primates. According to Kaplan et al. (2000), hunting selected for both lengthened childhoods and increased adult lifespans, sociality, reliance on socially transmitted information and skills, and, perhaps, most importantly of all, intelligence. As was the case with predation, hunting may, therefore, be responsible for many aspects of our physiology and cognition that do not appear to be immediately tied to hunting: aspects of intelligence, cooperation, social learning, and paternal investment in offspring, for example.

> An examination of the skills involved in hunting in preindustrial societies points to some of the ways that hunting might have shaped our cognition. The knowledge required for successful hunting is incredibly complex and increases into late adulthood. As a skill, hunting is in many ways more akin to mathematics or engineering than, for example, running a marathon (though it is that too; Bramble & Lieberman, 2004). Among the Ache and the Hiwi, for example, Kaplan and colleagues have documented that male hunting returns do not peak until around age 40. If hunting were more about strength and stamina than knowledge, one would expect hunting returns to peak earlier. Instead, hunting is clearly a knowledge-dependent skill at which older individuals can surpass younger ones, and anthropologists have documented elaborate and detailed knowledge related to hunting in adults in traditional societies (Blurton Jones & Konner, 1976; Kruuk, 2002; Liebenberg, 1990).

> Finally, direct interactions with prey, as well as predators, may have shaped mechanisms for detection of animate agents and predictive inferences about their behavior, including mechanisms of “mindreading,” or “theory of mind.” For example, from infancy humans, like many other animals, are attuned to interactions of chasing and pursuit, which capture attention and generate strong intuitions about goals and outcomes (Csibra, Bíró, Koós, & Gergely, 2003; Frankenhuis et al., 2013; Rochat, Striano, & Morgan, 2004). Indeed, it is possible that predator-prey interactions were an important, nonsocial source of selection on mechanisms of mindreading (Van Schaik & Van Hooff, 1983). Given the ancient origins of predator-prey interactions, which in vertebrates evolutionarily predate some forms of within-species social interaction such as parental care and cooperation, predation may be one of the oldest sources of selection for mindreading abilities.

I suggest that men packed their heads so full of this knowledge that they hallucinated the point of view of prey.

> Interactions with predators and prey create a variety of adaptive problems that can have effects on nearly all aspects of organismal function and design, from life histories, to morphology, physiology, and cognition. Unlike other aspects of the environment, which are either static or changing independently of the species that inhabit them, predators and prey coevolve with each other via evolutionary feedback akin to an arms race (Van Valen, 1973). This feedback can create complex evolutionary dynamics with cascading effects on the taxa involved.

> Indeed, even though there is good evidence for the influence of predator-prey interactions on many aspects of our bodies and minds, we still do not (and may never) know the full scope of that influence. It’s possible, for example, that some of the most fundamental features of human nature—from big brains, to sociality, to long lifespans, to our heavy reliance on social learning and cultural transmission—were selected for, in part, because of their benefits for avoiding predation, and because of the increasing reliance of ancestral hominins on a hunting way of life. If predator-prey interactions were partly responsible for setting us on the evolutionary path that has brought us to where we are today, the scope and depth of their effects on human psychology and physiology might be hard to overestimate.

> On the other side of the coin, humans are predators by nature. We have been hunters of other animals for millions of years. Far from diminishing with time, selection for the skills necessary to stalk and kill animals has accelerated over the course of human evolution, as hunting has played an ever-increasing role in human WEBC09 09/18/2015 23:41:9 Page 259 Adaptations to Predators and Prey 259 subsistence. For those who have never hunted, the difficulty of the task is easy to underestimate. Dawkins (1976) coined the term the “life/dinner principle” to refer to the asymmetry in fitness payoffs to predators and prey for the two possible outcomes of a predation event: If the predation event is a success, the predator wins dinner, but the prey loses his life; vice versa, if it fails. There is another asymmetry, which might be called the “anywhere but here” principle: For a predator to succeed, the predator must manage to be in exactly the same place as the prey at exactly the same time; for the prey to succeed, it need only be anywhere else. Obviously, it is much easier to satisfy the latter condition than the former. This means that whereas prey can use a variety of “dumb” tactics to avoid predation, including hiding, crypsis, and living in holes or trees, predators must be designed to bring about a very unlikely and nonrandom physical state of the world, which prey are expressly designed to avoid. For tool-using predators, there is an added complication: We must either cause our own position to converge with that of the prey or cause the position of a projectile or trap to do so. This poses other adaptive problems such as the perceptual and motor problems involved in successfully aiming a projectile. Predation, then, may select for particular kinds of intelligence, and our evolutionary legacy as hunters is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of the human mind. Some aspects of our intelligence that we do not attribute to our history as hunters—from mindreading, to tool use, to strategic coordination—may nevertheless exist at least partly because of it. Additionally, our minds are likely to be full of many detection, tracking, and behavior anticipation mechanisms of which we might not be fully aware.

Why does the first art have to come at around the time of inner voices? Maybe there are no inner voices yet? Maybe the first hallucinations were visual.

Huge gender effects in some visual processing. https://www.washington.edu/news/2018/08/16/men-and-women-show-surprising-differences-in-seeing-motion/

## Brain Modules


Claim is that men and women have a theory of mind module. Male module more specialized for representing animals. This is especially true of a _socialized_ person, who will have trained the TOM module to match a certain mind. 

footnote: Here is a recent [paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1093/bjps/axm038?journalCode=bjps) that argues against TOM module. Good to understand fault lines of current debate. Don’t really need the 

### Furries


Furries are those given to TOM for animals. They are overwhelmingly male. Also, incredibly autistic, the poster child candidate condition for study of TOM. Maybe furries another good population to study TOM.

Back to Fall of Man. In Eden men fully inhabited their Special Interest, naming animals, and talked directly with God. After the fall they attend Furry Conventions to scratch the itch. Truly, capitalism will provide.

Note that among general HS students, females more interested in communicating with animals, males more interested in hearing them. Maybe just do to greater female interest in communicating? http://www.weizmann.ac.il/st/blonder/sites/st.blonder/files/uploads/sohair.pdf

Tell me with a straight face that a furry didn’t paint this.

Academic paper on the subject, complete with a bunch of gobbledygook:

> Postmodern instability of identity gave rise to the furry1 phenomenon, representing an anthropomorphic animal, having human personalities and characteristics
> 
> The shaman is a liminal being − a sacral element that is in opposition to the profane community. It differs from his community through direct contact with sanctity, which he is also the embodiment of. One of essential elements of liminal beings is also minimization of sex distinctions. This element can be demonstrated through not distinguishing male and female participants of rituals or through eliminating the classification framework man – woman.

> Shamans living in traditional tribal societies had more than one soul, which enabled them to enter a supernatural world, where they got in contact with holiness. Postmodern furries enter the cyberspace, where they can, just as shamans do, generate different souls or take on different identities. Shamans and furries thus trespass the threshold of the profane world, though in different times, in order to modify their original personality and find new existential horizons of human feelings and cognition.

Would like to see a study of children’s art broken down by gender. Do boys draw more animals than girls? Open to the idea of an alternative hypothesis to the cave art:

### Alternative explanation: it’s all women


More pressure for TOM module, at least because of language. Better at mind reading and language today.

> In the first epiglacial period, the Mesolithic (lo/8,ooo-7/5,ooo B.C. the splendid art of the Upper palaeolithic hunters disappeared. The mesolithic hunters and fishermen practised a more schematizised, geometric art, mostly on pieces of bone and horn. Only the hunters of South Spain exercised a lifeful painting art on rocks. Famous is a picture frieze at Cogul, Prov. Lerida, which displays several animals, a group of dancing females with more or less raised arms and two females with raised arms apart. 18 The final impression of the whole assemblage-allegedly painted in intervals-is that of a magic scene, in which the women conjure the animals of hunt ~Adorants in Prehistoric Art: Prehistoric Attitudes and Gestures of Prayer

> This genuine art was produced by hunters and was in the first line restricted to animals of the hunting realm, but there appear, however much rarer, also human beings and beings of the transcendant world

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art

> Luckily for Snow, that wasn't a problem for the analysis of the prehistoric handprints. As it turned out—much to his surprise—the hands in the caves were much more sexually dimorphic than modern hands, meaning that there was little overlap in the various hand measurements.
> 
> "They fall at the extreme ends, and even beyond the extreme ends," Snow said. "Twenty thousand years ago, men were men and women were women."“

Claims that early cave paintings done by women. Not sure, but would fit with a bicameral reading where women heard voices first/better and thus channeled animals before the hunt. Always the animals they ate.

### wikipedia explanation


There is some debate about the gender of the artists.

> In the early 20th century, following the work of [Walter Baldwin Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Baldwin_Spencer) and [Francis James Gillen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_James_Gillen), scholars such as [Salomon Reinach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Reinach), [Henri Breuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Breuil) and [Count Bégouën](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henri_Begou%C3%ABn&action=edit&redlink=1) [[fr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Begou%C3%ABn)] interpreted the paintings as 'utilitarian' [hunting magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_magic) to increase the abundance of prey.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#cite_note-29) [Jacob Bronowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bronowski) states, "I think that the power that we see expressed here for the first time is the power of anticipation: the forward-looking imagination. In these paintings the hunter was made familiar with dangers which he knew he had to face but to which he had not yet come."[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#cite_note-30)
> 
> Another theory, developed by [David Lewis-Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis-Williams) and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary [hunter-gatherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) societies, is that the paintings were made by paleolithic [shamans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism).[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#cite_note-31) The shaman would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state, then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing out power from the cave walls themselves.
> 
> R. Dale Guthrie, who has studied both highly artistic and lower quality art and figurines, identifies a wide range of skill and age among the artists. He hypothesizes that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the representation of women in the [Venus figurines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines)) are the work of adolescent males, who constituted a large part of the [human population at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_demography).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#cite_note-guthrie-32)[_[verification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)_] However, in analyzing hand prints and stencils in French and Spanish caves, Dean Snow of Pennsylvania State University has proposed that a proportion of them, including those around the spotted horses in Pech Merle, were of female hands.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#cite_note-times_handprints-33)

### Weak or strong version?


Strong version: These were objects to aid in hallucinating the minds they were trying to model. Venus statue and cave animals spoke to the artists.

Weak version: these symbols represent what was on their minds

[make an argument that strong version fits better. Evolutionary reasons that these would be the minds we first modeled. Persistent gendered ppl vs things interests. Idols subsequently associated with religion (which bicameral reading says includes actual hallucinations).]

## Neanderthal introgression


The timing is interesting. We only see cave art after neanderthal introgression. From last paper we know that neanderthals did not have schizo genes. I think these are the genes related to ToM.

I suggest that Neanderthals had excellent hunting ToM. Homo Sapiens had a social ToM. (Compare clan sizes.) Some hybrid had the best of both worlds, and these cognitive combos would be heavily selected for. This is why we see the first cave art spring up in Europe right after Neanderthal introgression. If Homo Sapien sans introgression had the ability, why wouldn’t we see cave art in Africa? All we see are lines. Same as the Neanderthal cave art. Pictures of figures right after introgression implies there was a cognitive leap after Sapiens mated with Neanderthals. Hybrid vigor.

## Origins of bicameralism


Bicameral humans hallucinated their ToM. I think such a person would produce art. Therefore, I think that the bicameral mind must have been a product of Neanderthal hybridization. Two separate lineages developed ToM for different purposes. When combined some of their offspring had a new kind of ToM that produced hallucinations and art. 25k years later this would break down as described in the EToC, producing the modern levels of abstract thought.

## Gender diffs in face recognition


Seems as though men use a different system to recognize people.

This is consistent we EToC and the cave art. ToM in men was originally not about humans. We use a more general system to do this, whereas women have special hardware. This shows up in the first art where men draw figures of prey and women make figures of humans. Today it shows up on face recognition tasks. (And perhaps female children preferring dolls.)

Very common for feminists to say they live in a man’s world. Many correct points; since the bronze age men have dominated women. Face recognition seems to be a case of the reverse. Men can compensate with a general system, but it’s effortful. They remember faces in drag, walking backward in heels.

I would extend this to the entire social realm. As the modern world becomes more atomized, there is an epidemic of loneliness, particularly among the elderly who are no longer tied to society through raising kids or working. Humans are social creatures and for many this order of affairs is torture. Part of why men do worse, is the history of their consciousness. It is more recent, and repurposed from ToM designed to stalk prey.

## Cut paragraphs


> Clottes and Lewis-Williams point out that although shamanic cultures are very different from one another, there are remarkable similarities that point to a basic human universal: the way the human nervous system behaves in altered states.

Idols are universal. They help us hallucinate. Much like children are more prone to talk to their teddy bears than imaginary friend.

So the first idols we make are what we have the best theory of mind for.

kind of like: why watch porn? Sure, people can rub one out without it. But people are lazy and appreciate an image to get them in them in an ecstatic state.
