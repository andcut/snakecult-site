Every culture must answer who we are and where we came from. It is perhaps the most replicated finding in all of anthropology: creation myths are a human universal, essential for the functioning of a society. Man must know his place in the cosmos, or he will thrash about ineffectually, or lash out to bend the world to his deranged image (cf. the 20th century).

Creation myths have always employed artistic license. In the Garden of Eden, there is a talking snake. To the Egyptians, humans are tears of joy that fell from the Eye of Ra. And to academics, cognitive evolution stopped just before the first evidence of fully human behavior.

Our failure to honestly grapple with our origins is dangerous, and makes the world an uglier place. Still, as always, seeking this understanding is a foray into the heart of darkness. Australian men had their [penis split open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_subincision) halfway up the shaft before they could learn how Man came to be in the Dreamtime. Greek mystery cults celebrated from whence man came with snake orgies, shouting “Evoe, Evoe!”—“Eve, Eve!” In both cases, those who divulged the secrets were put to death[^1]. We live in softer times and our taboos have relaxed, but there still be dragons if one wants to understand the secret of our success.

### Received Wisdom


Nature is red in tooth and claw. Only the strong survive, and yet humans are weak in both tooth and claw. What we have is intelligence, which we use to make tools and work together. There is no debate that this is how our feeble species conquered the world. The question is whether the biological basis for our collaborative, imaginative minds was established two million years ago, 300,000, or in the last 50,000.

[Homo sapiens only became dominant in the last 50,000 years, replacing all our cousins (and many archaic sapiens lineages) from 50-15kya. That’s right, non-human lineages likely existed that recently. Additionally, human culture starts to emerge 50kya, and is only really established in the last 10kya.

The current model is that had nothing to do with new human abilities like language, metacognition, or symbolic thought evolving. That change was entirely cultural. The above quotes are actually outdated. The current party line is that there hasn’t been any significant evolution in the last 300,000 years, since the Khoi San split from the rest of humanity. ]

The above quotes arguing evolution stopped 50,000 years ago are somewhat dated. What they are really defending is the idea that evolution stopped once groups separated.

The above quotes are somewhat dated. More recent models say evolution stopped 300kya. Both are really arguments that, since populations split apart, there has been no evolution. (Understanding the political motivation will be left as an exercise for the reader.) This produces Frankenstein models like:

[maybe introduce the argument briefly. There is no argument that there was a cultural revolution at the same time humans took over the earth. What is debated if this was associated with an attendant cognitive evolution. That we became human in this time period. That a homo sapien from 100kya, adopted today, would function in modern society. The quotes above are about the last 50kya, but now the model has become a frankenstein because the last common ancestor is 300kya. Hundreds of thousands of years without acting human. Sapient Paradox.]

### Dwarkesh Patel, Man on a Mission


Podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, regularly lands interviews with the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Scott Alexander, and (I presume) upcoming conversations with Satoshi and Shinzo Abe. Like all curious people, he is fascinated by human origins. Unlike most, he can devote weeks of prep before interrogating the world’s leading authorities. This article is framed as a response to his interviews with two Harvard scientists: geneticist David Reich and evolutionary biologist Joseph Henrich. Patel’s is the best-case scenario for candid inquiry into these questions. And yet, the answers he received from these decorated researchers seem to deny the darwinian paradigm.

Reich’s work, spread across academic articles and his popular book _Who We Are and Where We Came From_ , provides an exhaustive account of humanity’s geographic origin, compiled by exhuming thousands of ancient graves and sequencing their DNA. 100,000 years ago there were a half dozen members of the _Homo_ family, and _sapiens_ was nothing special. A regional species with mental capabilities no more developed than the Neanderthal or any of our other cousins. Then, around 70,000 years ago, a small branch of _sapiens_ broke off and conquered the world in a matter of tens of thousands of years (the latest Denisovan admixture in Papua New Guinea is estimated at 15-30 kya). At the same time, our ancestors started making artifacts that reflect symbolic thought. The most blindly obvious model is that human cognition evolved in this period. As luck would have it, molecular genetics allows us to test this hypothesis. Reich explains his colleagues’ attempt:

> **Reich** : “There’s been one incredibly interesting and weird line of genetic evidence that was so weird that a lot of people I know dropped off the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15020-6). They just didn’t want to be associated with it because it was so weird. They just thought it might be wrong. It's stood up, as far as I can tell. It's just so weird…They looked at the set of differentially methylated regions, roughly 1000 of them, that were systematically different on the modern human lineage. They asked what characterized them? Were there particular biological activities that were very unusual on the modern human specific lineage? There was a huge statistical signal that was very, very surprising and unexpected. It was the vocal tract. It was the laryngeal and pharyngeal tract.
> 
> …If you think this change in the vocal tract is important in language, which seems reasonable, then maybe that's telling you that there are very important changes that have happened…specifically on our lineage that were absent in Neanderthals and Denisovans.”

That language might be the secret of human success is hardly surprising. The idea is ancient, woven into countless creation myths about what distinguishes humans from beasts. Naively, what is surprising is that scientists don’t want to know the answer now that they have the tools. Stranger still, Reich—a geneticist—routinely emphasizes that victorious groups likely had no inherent advantage over their vanquished cousins, attributing humanity’s triumph largely to random chance. Darwin spins in his grave!

Ultimately, Reich punts on the central question: what precisely makes humans human. This question, he insists, lies beyond genetics, better left to anthropologists and evolutionary biologists. Conveniently enough, his colleague Joseph Henrich happens to be both.

### The Secret to Our Success


According to Henrich, _Homo sapiens_ ’ meteoric rise was powered by culture, not raw intelligence. Individually, early humans were no smarter than—and possibly even cognitively inferior to—Neanderthals, yet our unique aptitude for high-fidelity imitation enabled incremental cultural improvements to compound dramatically over generations. Henrich uses the Inuit kayak as a canonical example: an exquisitely engineered vessel adapted for arctic hunting, whose complex design no single individual could invent from scratch. Instead, it arose incrementally—generations tweaking and copying each other’s slight improvements, until the end result outperforms anything one person could design alone.

Henrich likens cumulative cultural evolution to biological evolution. Just as natural selection can craft intricate structures like the eye through blind, incremental adaptations, cultural evolution aggregates vast troves of trial-and-error knowledge without requiring individual foresight or genius. Over millennia, simple biases—such as preferentially copying prestigious or successful individuals—can foster profound cultural complexity. Societies equipped with superior rituals, tools, and social norms inevitably outcompete and displace groups with less effective cultural traditions.

Henrich even goes so far as to claim that humans have gotten progressively dumber over the last 50,000 years—precisely the period during which we conquered the planet, mastered abstract thought, and started producing art. His primary evidence is cranial volume: Neanderthals possessed brains roughly 10% larger than those of the Paleolithic Homo sapiens who replaced them. Moreover, human brain size has continued to decline significantly over the past 50,000 years, particularly during the last 10,000—a period marked, paradoxically, by explosive technological innovation and the rise of complex civilizations.

However elegant, Henrich’s model will not survive the ancient DNA revolution. During the brief interval between Patel’s interviews, Reich’s lab released a groundbreaking preprint titled _[Pervasive Findings of Directional Selection Realize the Promise of Ancient DNA to Elucidate Human Adaptation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.14.613021v1)_. This massive genomic study of thousands of ancient individuals reveals compelling evidence for strong selection pressures favoring intelligence over the past 10,000 years—precisely the opposite of Henrich’s prediction of declining cognitive capacities.

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KjDT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3149ac3-7323-4671-9384-cb270d5b62f4_998x478.png)

The grey line shows the estimated change in average polygenic scores (PGS) for intelligence and household income in Europe over the last 9,000 years. A PGS is calculated by summing all the genetic variants that contribute positively or negatively to a trait. While it's an estimate and subject to potential errors, such significant changes are unlikely to be due to chance alone. The magnitude of change is striking: 9,000 years ago, the PGS for IQ was two standard deviations lower than today. If similar changes are projected back 50,000 years, it suggests that most individuals in those populations might not have had the cognitive capacity for fully developed grammatical language or abstract thought. This aligns closely with the “weird” result that surfaced strong evolutionary signals on the laryngeal tract, and is enough to fully explain why our lineage took over the world.

[Both the answers are not only evasive, they are wrong. Answering who we are is not beyond the purview of genetics. That field has valuable tools that need to be integrated with psychology, philosophy, etc. The secret of our success is not just culture, it is our brains. We are smarter than other animals. We were smarter than neanderthals, and have gotten smarter since then. But smarter isn’t the half of it, we have evolved metacognition. And with it, a need to know who we are and where we came from.

There is no option to ignore this question, and it is foolhardy to try. Academics were not always like this. To get a sense of the loss, read Masks of God, which integrates philosophy, psychology, archeology, and mythology to build a natural history of the human condition. It is not evasive like the current batch, content with nobel lies.]

### Into the Heart of Darkness


[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vrAe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8f72d1a-84af-4868-884e-3899952b5599_1452x1093.jpeg)

[image of a black hole]

You cannot observe a black hole directly—that’s precisely the point—but you can see the distortions it creates around itself. Thus far we have danced around the black hole at the heart of evolutionary science. 

The above results from Reich’s lab are from Europe. There are political complications in exhuming the graves of non-europeans, but eventually such studies will be performed. What model will those support, do you think? Will they show a decrease in intelligence in the Holocene, as Henrich predicts? Doubtful. What is more certain: the results will be hotly debated. For many scientists believe that if there is a genetic basis for humanity’s unique cognitive leap Hitler will rise again to make one last amphetamine-addled march for the Caucasus.

Yet the greater danger lies in burying our heads in the sand. Without an accurate origin story, humans thrash about—rootless, paranoid, and vulnerable to false ideologies. Those who don’t know their nature manufacture hell on earth. Man has no choice but to try and understand who he is and where he came from, with whatever tools available. I am confident that if we do so with eyes open to evolutionary insights, our origin myth will prove stranger and more beautiful than we have yet imagined. As an intuition pump, consider your inner voice. This voice is a recent evolutionary artifact, a direct product of language. If full grammatical language arose only about 100,000 years ago, that inner voice—the incessant narrator of your thoughts—must have taken form even more recently. Imagine its intermediate evolutionary stages: did early humans immediately recognize it as their own internal creation, or did it first appear as an external presence, a spirit, a deity? Were there tribes who recognized the inner voice as their own, interacting with—and perhaps outcompeting—neighbors who still perceived it as divine command? What might those encounters have looked like? And consider the overlooked vanguard of the cognitive revolution: women. If language evolved to navigate complex social relationships, it would be women who first grasped, articulated, and propagated the human condition.

For now, geneticists will quietly continue to gather “weird” results at odds with prevailing blank-slate assumptions. Ambitious researchers will continue to drop off those papers. But eventually the dam will break and we will admit that humans—including our brains—are products of evolution. Much like how the geocentric model could not survive the telescope, blank slate creationism cannot survive the ability to sequence ancient DNA. Accepting our nature will, I hope, allow us to have a less pathological view of our inheritance, and more ability to build a future worthy of it.

Man must act, so he invents creation myths to frame his life. Cultures that failed to do so were ground under the feet of those who knew their place in the world. Our modern myth is “Out of Africa” fused to Blank Slate Creationism. The first is little more than a travel log; the second, an article of faith insisting each human mind emerges immaculate and untouched by biology. This faith leads to paradoxes when projected onto our distant past. When exactly did our species transcend its evolutionary heritage, severing culture from cognition? By what mysterious mechanism did biology conjure minds independent of biology itself? There is a hollowness at the center of our origin story. This essay explores why we persist in orbiting that black hole.

Darwin’s project is finished and we admit Humans, their brain included, evolved. Our culture is incredible, but it is downstream of cognitive advancements. Further, as culture got more complex—adding imaginary concepts like dragons or “I”—it selected for more intelligence, more imagination, more humanness.

For now, the scientific community remains cautious, diligently collecting “weird” results that challenge existing narratives. But eventually, the weight of evidence will become undeniable. Darwin’s unfinished project will finally come to fruition, affirming that humans—including our brains—are products of ongoing evolutionary pressures. Culture, indeed magnificent, is downstream of biology, not its replacement. Rather than making us cognitively complacent, increasingly complex culture—populated with imaginary beings like dragons or abstract notions like the self—has continually intensified selective pressure for greater intelligence, richer imagination, and deeper humanity.

One of the most replicable findings in anthropology is that every culture has a creation myth. The most human question we can ask—that we must ask, it seems—is who we are and where we came from. Humans have been doing so for tens of thousands of years. And yet, modern man, with his evolved epistemology and reams of data, cannot bear to look squarely at the question. We have tabooed it, lest Hitler rise from the grave and make another amphetamine-addled march for the Caucasus. 

This may sound hyperbolic, but Dwarkesh Patel recently asked two decorated scientists the basic human question: what makes us human? Who are we? Where did we come from? The first was a geneticist who wrote a best-selling book, Who We Are And Where We Came From. Patel titled that interview, “How One Small Tribe Conquered the World 70,000 Years Ago,” but there was one glaring problem: the interview danced around the why. What is it that allowed sapiens to be the last Homo standing? Reich can only offer furtive speculation, but suggests Dwarkesh speak to a real expert, his colleague Joseph Henrich on the matter. Henrich offers a broad-ranging interview, but whiffs on what changed in the last 70,000 years. 

The first passed the buck and the second whiffed. This is extremely informative to those who can read the situation. Let me explain.

### Geneticist David Reich


100,000 years ago there were a half dozen members of the _Homo_ family, and _sapiens_ was nothing special. A regional species with mental capabilities no more developed than the Neanderthal or any of our other cousins. Then, around 70,000 years ago, a small branch of _sapiens_ broke off and conquered the world in a matter of tens of thousands of years (the latest Denisovan admixture in Papua New Guinea is perhaps 15-30 kya). At the same time, our ancestors started making artifacts that reflect symbolic thought. The most blindly obvious model is that human cognition evolved in this period. As luck would have it, molecular genetics allows us to test this hypothesis. 

In the first of this pair of interviews, Reich explains his colleagues’ attempt:

> **Reich** : There’s been one incredibly interesting and weird line of genetic evidence that was so weird that a lot of people I know dropped off the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15020-6). They just didn't want to be associated with it because it was so weird. They just thought it might be wrong. It's stood up, as far as I can tell. It's just so weird…They looked at the set of differentially methylated regions, roughly 1000 of them, that were systematically different on the modern human lineage. They asked what characterized them? Were there particular biological activities that were very unusual on the modern human specific lineage? There was a huge statistical signal that was very, very surprising and unexpected. It was the vocal tract. It was the laryngeal and pharyngeal tract.
> 
> …If you think this change in the vocal tract is important in language, which seems reasonable, then maybe that's telling you that there are very important changes that have happened…specifically on our lineage that were absent in Neanderthals and Denisovans.

Now to be clear, the only “weird” thing about language evolving in the last 100,000 years is that it disrupts decades of **blank-slate creationism** in the academy. Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution, except the human brain and laryngeal tract, which are conveniently beyond the forces of mere genetics. Or at least that is how scientists act.

As with most cover-ups, there are noble intentions. To put it bluntly, if language evolved in the last 100,000 years, we should expect group differences in intelligence. As such, scientists have tabooed the human special sauce being something about the individual psyche. If there is something special about our biology, it was set _before_ our species split into groups. That is the logic of models such as this:

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gtFl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ade3dcc-8c44-43e7-9089-9ce541acae70_754x682.jpeg)

Notice that human universals such as language, art, spirituality, storytelling, and marriage are all said to go back 300,000 years. There is zero evidence for this, except that the Khoe San split from the human lineage at that point. Archeologically, art is not widespread until just 10,000 years ago and non-existent before 50,000.

I have been accused of being something like a young earth creationist for treating Genesis as a memory of the transition to sapience. But here it is actually the New Testament which is more applicable. Consider how John opens his Gospel, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the word was God.” This is a metaphysical claim that Logos preceded the material world. This claim is downstream centuries of philosophical insights about how our experience is mediated through symbolic thought (ie language, it is not an accident that ‘logos’ is translated as Word in English). Academic adherence to the blank slate has plunged us literally thousands of years backwards in our understanding of what it means to be human. For if language (or symbolic thought, or logos, or recursion) is the secret to our success, then there must be a genetic component. 

This blank slate creationism has set us back literally thousands of years. You may be familiar with the Gospel of John, which opens: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Word, in the original greek is Logos, the root of our word ‘logic,’ and which means the organizing principle of the universe. It is a metaphysical claim that mind is greater than matter, and that both mind and matter emanated from something like a Big Bang of mind. But let’s leave the metaphysical claim as it may be, and try to understand what this is saying about you and I. The message of the New Testament is that we are children of God, children of Logos. By virtue of having logos—language—we are a shard of God in his own image.

It is not just Christians that cast language as human’s defining feature. 

Questions that man has grappled with since the Stone Age

Last year 

Dwarkesh Patel

interviewed Geneticist David Reich 

You would think that Harvard scientists who write best-selling books like _The Secret of Our Success_ and _Who We Are And Where We Came From_ could answer why Homo Sapiens took over the planet. But to do so is against their religion, so to speak. Or at least against the prevailing ideology of their patrons and colleagues.

Had a very productive chatGPT convo where I made a more in depth outline: https://chatgpt.com/share/67eea7cd-44b4-8008-a67e-4da790404672

Given this, one would expect an answer to who humans are, and what allowed them to conquer the world. But alas, Reich pointedly does not answer the “how.” 

GPT v2:

This didn’t stop after our cousins had been the pattern ever since. Corded Ware replacing [pre-Indo-European group they wiped out], Bantu replacing Pygmie, and Clovic Culture replacing the mysterious people who lived in the areas for ten thousand years, producing no art, wiping out no species, and leaving hardly a trace. This process, Reich assures us, is mostly noise. The evolutionary winners at no point had any evolutionary advantage. It was luck, mostly.

  
Podcaster Dwarkesh Patel regularly lands interviews with figures like Mark Zuckerberg, Scott Alexander, and (presumably soon) Satoshi and Shinzo Abe. Like all curious minds, he is fascinated by human origins. Unlike most, he devotes weeks of meticulous preparation before interrogating the world’s leading experts. Here, I frame my exploration as a response to Patel’s insightful conversations with two Harvard scientists: geneticist David Reich and anthropologist Joseph Henrich. Patel represents a best-case scenario for candid inquiry, yet even under ideal conditions, these decorated researchers seem oddly resistant to applying Darwinian logic to human evolution.

Reich, in his acclaimed book _Who We Are and Where We Came From_ , provides an exhaustive account of humanity’s geographic origin, compiled by exhuming thousands of ancient graves and sequencing their DNA. This travel log is written in blood—wave after wave, Homo sapiens systematically replaced Neanderthals, Denisovans, and countless other lineages whose bones now speak only to geneticists. The process never ceased: symbolic thought and spears merely intensified competition, leaving behind endless casualties whose genetic codes Reich extracts from pulverized bones. Yet, paradoxically, Reich emphasizes randomness in this narrative, arguing that Homo sapiens’ success involved no inherent biological superiority—just luck.

This is peculiar. Within mere millennia, our species carved paths through deserts, jungles, and tundra, defeating competitors who had evolved in those niches over vast epochs. Could it truly be coincidence that our sudden global dominance precisely coincides with evidence of symbolic cognition?

Pressed on this point, Reich admits one tantalizing genetic anomaly that could explain human exceptionalism:

> “There’s been one incredibly interesting and weird line of genetic evidence so odd that many colleagues dropped off the paper. It’s stood up to scrutiny. Researchers examined roughly 1,000 differentially methylated genomic regions unique to modern humans. The strongest statistical signal was linked to the vocal tract—specifically the laryngeal and pharyngeal regions. If language evolved significantly in this period, and the evidence strongly suggests it did, then perhaps these unique genetic developments enabled our distinct cognitive trajectory.”

To clarify: the only truly “weird” aspect here is that the finding disrupts decades of academic blank-slate orthodoxy. “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,” except, apparently, the human brain and speech anatomy, which are suspiciously treated as immune from genetic logic.

Why did Reich’s colleagues shy away from such findings? We will revisit this question. Ultimately, Reich punts on precisely how symbolic thought or language enabled humans to conquer the globe, deflecting to anthropology. For deeper answers, he directs Patel to Joseph Henrich.

Now to be clear, the only “weird” thing about language evolving in the last 100,000 years is that it disrupts decades of **blank-slate creationism** in the academy. Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution, except the human brain and laryngeal tract, which are conveniently beyond the forces of mere genetics. 

Professor David Reich wrote a book on population genetics titled, Who We Are And Where We Came From. The interview with Patel is titled, “How One Small Tribe Conquered the World 70,000 Years Ago.” Given this, one would expect an answer to who humans are, and what allowed them to conquer the world. But Reich ultimately punts on the question of “how.”

This travel log is written in blood—wave after wave, Homo sapiens systematically replaced Neanderthals, Denisovans, and countless other dead-end lineages whose bones now speak only to geneticists. The process never ceased: symbolic thought and spears merely intensified competition, leaving behind endless casualties whose genetic codes Reich extracts from pulverized bones. Yet, paradoxically, Reich emphasizes randomness in this narrative, arguing that Homo sapiens’ success involved no inherent biological superiority—just luck.

He offers a detailed travel log of where humans came from, pieced together by exhuming thousands of graves, and sequencing the DNA. These bodies tell a tale red in tooth and claw. Wave after wave, Homo Sapiens replaced Neanderthals and Denisovans. And this process never stopped. Spears and symbolic thought simply ratcheted up the competition. For tens of thousands of years the successful have buried those that could not compete, wave after wave. Countless lost lines speak only to geneticists who grind their bones into a fine powder, from which genetic material is chemically isolated, purified, and sequenced. Strangely, Reich, a geneticist, makes clear that this process is mostly random. The winners of this contest were not superior in any way.

This is strange. In a few thousand years Homo Sapiens blaze a path through desert, jungle, and tundra, conquering native competitors who had evolved to those niches from time untold. Are we to believe there was no advantage that made humans so adaptable? That it is a concidence that our dominance coincides with the first evidence of symbolic thought? 

When pressed, Reich discusses the evolution of language. Some scientists hold that language—not just communication, but our flexible grammar—is associated with the Upper Paleolithic Revolution 50,000-100,000 years ago. Interestingly, in the short list of 1,000 genes that differentiate Homo Sapiens from Neanderthals and Denisovans, many are related to the laryngeal tract, implying that it was language which made humans special. This result was so “weird” that several of Reich’s friends dropped off the paper because they didn’t want to be associated with it.

Why do you think that is? We will return to that question, but, in the end, Reich punts. The question of what makes humans human is beyond the purview of genetics. He suggests Patel talk to his colleague, anthropologist Joseph Henrich.
