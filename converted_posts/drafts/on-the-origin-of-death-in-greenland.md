> “The Eskimo do not greatly trouble themselves with thoughts as to the beginnings of the world as a whole; rather they take it for granted, quite unspeculatively. There is, however, an odd Greenlandic tale of how earth dropped down from the heavens, soil and stones, forming the lands we know. Babies came forth — earth-born — and sprawled about among the dwarf willows; and there they were found by a man and a woman (none knows whence these came), and the woman made clothes for them, and so there were people; and the man stamped upon the earth, whence sprang, each from its tiny mound, the dogs that men need. At first there was no death; neither was there any sun. Two old women debated, and one said, “Let us do without light, if so we can be without death”; but the other said, “Nay, let us have both light and death!”—and as she spoke, it was so.

Stories of the Great Deluge are inherently interesting because we may be dealing with cultural memories that stretch back 10,000 years. The fact this particular tale includes several ancient and widespread themes strengthens the case. Let’s start with the parallels to Genesis. Women are blamed for the origin of death, there is a tradeoff between light/knowledge and life, clothing is part of the human package, and clothes-making women are the civilizer (derogatory, in the case of Genesis). With that out of the way, let’s consider the dog fucking.

I asked o3 for other cultures that have a myth saying their people are the result of the union with a first woman and a dog:

Interestingly, these are from a contiguous geographic region stretching from Siberia to Japan to the Pacific Northwest to Greenland. If this myth bursts forth from the collective unconscious, why only in this region? This hints at a phylogeny. 

Notice that like the Greeks, Hebrews, and many others, women are blamed for the origin of death. Also, like Genesis   
  
[list all five]

#### **1\. Women as the Origin of Death**


You are familiar with Eve and Pandora, but blaming women for death is a widespread phenomenon. 

Bonus: over on snakecult.net I posted an o3-generated table of other examples:

As far as I can tell, there isn’t any phylogenetic research on women as origin of death by the likes of Berezkin or d’Huy (who [tackled the Primordial Matriarchy](https://shs.hal.science/halshs-01790319/document), which his phylogenetic tree says precedes the Out of Africa migration due to the global distribution). 

#### TEXT I ACTUALLY WROTE


Stories of the great deluge are inherently interesting because we may be dealing with a tale from the end of the Ice Age. The fact this story includes several widely-dispersed themes ups those odds.

[give a few-word description of each of these so people know what they are getting into. Can change the order if that makes more sense. Then give a paragraph-or-so treatment of each. Include hyperlinks to research.]

First, women as the cause of death. Like Pandora, Eve, or many other women in sub-saharan african myths [look them up]. 

Second, the tradeoff between light (knowledge, life) and death. Straight out of Genesis.

Third, the bit about union with a dog has parallels to stories in Siberia. Some argue that myths about dogs go back to the Ancient North Eurasians, who domesticated dogs and then spread in all directions. Their genes show up down through the Caucuses, into the Near East, down into East Asia, and they are the principal ancestors of the native americans. We know their dogs reached all parts of the world so there is no question part of their cultural package covered the globe. I think this story may be a surviving piece. Also, the ANE are on the short list for having invented the bullroarer cult (if it spread worldwide, who else would it be?).

Fourth, there is some phylogenetic work on the Old Woman = Death motif, which is found among the plains indians as well, and scattered through Africa and Oceania. Phylogeny doesn’t support global, but it is very old. And of course, see 1, the more general case is globobal

Fifth (maybe put higher up in order, in place #2?), women as civilizers. They make clothes, which is important for the definition of people. Like Adam and Eve, who put on clothes when they realize their nakedness. Symbolic of moving out of nature.

Another version of the Fall: https://archive.org/details/mythologyofall10gray/page/106/mode/2up?view=theater

It was Mother Corn who, with the help of the animals, led the people from the under Into the upper world, after which she apportioned territories, and taught the use of implements and ceremonial rites. Previous to their coming, the earth was inhabited by a race of people “so strong that they were not afraid of anybody, but they did not have good sense; they made fun of all the gods in heaven.” This sounds curiously like the Greek myth of the race of Giants; nor is the sequel unlike the Greek. “Nesaru looked down upon them, and was angry. Nesaru said: ‘I made them too strong. I will not keep them. They think that they are like myself. I shall destroy them, but I shall put away my people that I like and that are smaller.’” The giants were killed in a flood, while the animals and maize were preserved in a cave. Eventually, from an ear of maize which he had raised in heaven, Nesaru created a woman. Mother Corn, whom he sent into the underworld to deliver the people imprisoned there, and to lead them once more into the light of day — a Descent Into Hell, like that of Ishtar or Persephone or many another Corn Goddess.
