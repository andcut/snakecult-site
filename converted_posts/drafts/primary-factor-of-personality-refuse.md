## Cut paragraphs


I believe that the Big Five inhibits research. The most relevant signal, PFP, is spread over several factors. We can develop a general model of personality that is theoretically satisfying. I’m partial to the first three unrotated factors: Social Self-Regulation / emotional intelligence / social intelligence / alpha / stability / Affiliation, beta/plasticity/energy/Dynamism, and goal-oriented/Order. This is parsimonious, explanatory, and replicates across cultures. If we’re hungry for another factor throw in Emotional Attachment. 

Will discuss general models at length in future posts. For now we are in the early years yet of the lexical renaissance. Let’s no`t make the same mistake and set a half-baked model in stone. We still have much to learn from language.

[I worry that discussing alternatives to the Big Five is too much. This post is about PFP, not a general model.]

Remember, the BFI is derivative of language data. It is designed to approximate the Big Five markers, which are a rotation of the first five lexical PCs. As Ashton notes, if we want to understand the nature of these higher order factors, we have to go back to the “lower level personality variables that define the personality factors”. 

The nature of latent factors of surveys will always be a function of the design of the survey. What if we design a survey to match the structure of personality descriptions in language? Well, first, we would have invented word vectors (cite me). Second, this allows us to make more fundamental claims about latent factors, via the Lexical Hypothesis. This is the path we follow to understand α.

“[The Big Five] provides an account of personality that is **primarily descriptive** rather than explanatory, emphasizes regularities in behavior rather than inferred dynamic and developmental processes”. 

I’d go farther and say word-level data. This is the original idea of the Lexical Hypothesis. The nature of latent factors of surveys will always be a function of the design of the survey. What if we design a survey to match the structure of personality descriptions in language? Well, first, we would have invented word vectors (cite me). Second, this allows us to make more fundamental claims about latent factors. We can do the same for α.

### Other names for FFP


Intelligence research has _g_. Personality research, on the other hand, has several competing general factors derived in different populations, using different instruments, which result in different qualitative descriptions. As already discussed, there is Alpha, GFP. But also Big One, Stability, general factor of psychopathology, (p factor) and General factor of personality disorder (g-PD). The last two have high quality empirical data connecting them to GFP so let’s take a closer look.

#### _p_ factor


psychopathology refers to BLANK. The p factor exists “above the correlated internalizing and externalizing dimensions identified originally by Achenbach”. P is a “more powerful predictor of important life outcomes across time than the specific factors.”

“Sometimes I think someone else is removing thoughts from my head”

#### _g_ -PD


personality disorders are BLANK

General factor of personality disorder (g-PD) defined by self-interpersonal impairments. All of the borderline personality disorder (BPD) criteria loaded solely and highly on the _g_ -PD factor. Additional personality disorder criteria loaded on this factor (e.g., obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and antisocial), but with only a few exceptions these criteria also loaded on one of the more specific factors.

#### Emotional/Social Intelligence


Besides the major latent factor of any survey, FFP is often compared to emotional or social intelligence, achieving very high correlations (eg 0.9). Lexical FFP is the view from society, and therefore will load more on conformity and decorum than those labels suggest. Napoleon and Hitler certainly had social intelligence. But they occupy the role of third rail monster in popular imagination (the latter now replacing the former). Intelligence implies a sort of raw power that can be used for good or bad, FFP requires social approval.

### **Hypothesis**


FFP is real and all of these general factors from different surveys and populations are measuring the same underlying variable. Where there is disagreement it can be explained by range restriction introduced by instruments. Further, the best way to study the FFP is via natural language. This prevents researchers from introducing various kinds of bias and connects the factor to language yielding additional theoretical insights.

### Empirical equivalence


p and g-PD are shown to be equivalent by McCabe et al. GFP is quite correlated at 0.78. This is a range restriction problem. If we take the Lexical Hypothesis seriously, then traits like patricidal or delusional are part of general personality. However, most people are a 0 on the patricidal scale. Delusional is less extreme but certainly the distribution of individuals would not be normal. The p and g-PD scales have many questions about whether someone is delusional. For instruments measuring general personality, the choice was made to only include concepts where many people score greater than 0. This is a fine for an instrument where there is limited space to ask questions, but does not change the lexical foundation of general personality. To solve this, the strategy would be to literally take questions from psychoticism and personality disorder scales and add them to the personality measurement. Given that, we don’t have to run a study to show that a GFP thus derived would correlate more than 0.78. 

“It is noteworthy that the GFE was most heavily defined by _p_ factor indicators (along with some of the personality disorder and self-interpersonal impairments) and least by the GFP indicators. These results are consistent with the level of impairment interpretation, as the general psychopathology scales (e.g., psychosis) clearly involve considerably more impairment than the general personality measures.”

Noteworthy that the frame of p and G-p are negative. Not only that they correlate at an astounding 0.96 but were qualitatively described differently. Perhaps dostoyevsky is right that all good homes are similar but each broken one is in its own way. For communication, a name has to be given. Is it better to describe the positive pole?

PC1 cutler/condon. Ashton pushed back against Alpha existing at all because it was derived from correlations among factors. He said that one needed item-level data to make such claims. I’d go farther and say one needs word-level data to make sure the structure is not an artifact of the item set. We did just that (insert correlation plot of alpha and beta and our first two PCs with the Big Five). 

Had Digman extended his analysis to a third factor, would it look like Order? Working with item-level (word?) data in several languages, that is what Raad (?) found the third unrotated PC to be. Condon and I did as well in NLP data. At any rate, d

A second thing to consider in this study is that the participants are a biased sample: those that are receiving mental health treatment, or have in the past year or so. It therefore stands to reason that on this sample more variance would be explained by the extreme questions as this population is more distributed across the axis of, eg., feeling their body doesn’t belong to them.

Thirdly, PCA seeks to minimize reconstruction error. If there are more questions/factors devoted to certain ideas, this drags the first PC in their direction. There are many more factors related to p and g-PD than general personality, thus the GFE is biased towards those notions.

With these three considerations, we can be confident that GFP and g-PD are more more similar than the correlation of 0.78 suggests. Together does this get to 0.9? Is that enough to say two constructs are measuring the same thing? Hard to say. But qualitatively, the fac

This post doesn’t introduce any more data, but rather extrapolates from the recent work of McCabe, Oltmanns, and Widager (2022). They administer a host of surveys to 383 people who have or are receiving mental health treatment. The surveys include 10 measures of psychopathology (total n = ), two measures of personality (total n = 164), two measures of personality disorder (total n = 250), and two orders of self-interpersonal impairment (total n = 146). The latter was

Introduce the GFE paper. They try to unify p, G-p and GFP by giving a collection of surveys (2 hours worth!) to 300 individuals who have received care for mental health. They succeed to a surprising degree on p and G-p: correlation of 0.96. There is also a large correlation with GFP (0.78). They explain this disparity by range restriction. In this population of people with problems, most variance is explained by ‘how much problems’ that isn’t well measured by the normal questions in general personality.

This is a range restriction problem of the Big Five Inventory. Almost everyone is a 0 on the patricidal scale, so it doesn’t make sense to include extreme questions (eg murderous, bigoted, delusional) that will be administered to the general population. But they are still part of *general* personality by virtue of them earning lexical real estate. Condon and I showed that NLP can recover the first PC almost exactly the same as surveys (0.9 corr? among oregon folks?). In my opinion this would be higher if the survey sample was better (ie, the psychology students—children, in the eyes of car rental companies—being surveyed could define all the words and were not so WEIRD).

To be clear about the claim and evidence. General personality inventories limit what is asked because they are concerned with placing people on a normal spectrum. This is a choice and not inherent to general personality. Indeed, if we take the Lexical Hypothesis seriously then extreme proclivities like being animalistic or patricidal are part of personality. On 435 words I have shown that NLP and surveys produce the same first PC. I have also shown that the first PC is the same in NLP when we factor using 435 or 2019 words. Of the 2019 words the ones that load strongest on PC1 are quite extreme. They are words like XXXX, which aligns well with the p and G-p descriptions. So I claim that the GFP and p correlation would go up if a less range-restricted instrument were to be used. Because the range restriction is substantial, I expect there would be a substantial increase to the 0.78 between GFP and p/g-P. The paper already treated the 0.78 as “maybe it’s all the same”; we can be more confident of that position.

Top 30 words on PC1.

p and G-p are the same (corr like 0.96 in the paper), and yet have different interpretations in the various literatures. This is a big downside of describing factors qualitatively instead of by word loadings. Two people can look at the same factor and describe it in very different terms. p is described as interpersonal problems and g-p is described as impulsivity problems, despite empirically correlating at 0.96. Of course, the high correlation wasn’t known until after this enormous study. When describing my own factors, I hope to mitigate this problem by emphasizing word loadings more than my qualitative descriptions. (It’s not simply that I don’t have the theoretical chops to describe factors, I swear.)

The Big Five hobbles personality research. There is so much theory connected to GFP, p, p-G, Stability, Alpha, and NLPC1 that cannot be adequately ported onto personality research. When GFP or Big Two research is related to the Big Five, a hierarchical model is used to explain how the Big Five—ostensibly orthogonal—all correlate so strongly to these super-factors. If both survey and nlp data both suggest the GFP is the first factor, why is the relationship between GFP and the Lexically derived Big Five still unclear? This basic model has been referenced by 400k papers according to google scholar, why is it still an open question?

### NLP view of FFP


As previously argued, NLP data is far superior to survey data. Instead of self-report in an unnatural setting, we get the personality structure implied by millions of speakers engaged in living. If we believe in the Lexical Hypothesis, this is the data to use. And if we don’t, why make such a todo about the Big Five being lexically identified? Here are the top 50 word on either pole of the FFP from a list of 2019 adjectives embedded using DeBERTa.

**Positive:** 'considerate', 'good-tempered', 'well-mannered', 'courteous', 'gracious', 'pleasant', 'kind', 'polite', 'congenial', 'fair-minded', 'gentle-minded', 'kindly', 'kindhearted', 'good-hearted', 'agreeable', 'fair-natured', 'companionable', 'civil', 'nice', 'respectful', 'cordial', 'good-natured', 'hospitable', 'amicable', 'approachable', 'pleasing', 'gentle', 'warm-hearted', 'well-spoken', 'caring', 'helpful', 'loving', 'open-hearted', 'graceful', 'calming', 'amiable', 'peaceful', 'cooperative', 'benevolent', 'reassuring', 'supportive', 'accommodating', 'genial', 'affable', 'well-adjusted', 'soothing', 'temperate', 'personable', 'compassionate', 'good-humored'

**Negative:** 'ill-natured', 'abusive', 'ill-mannered', 'ungraceful', 'insulting', 'mean-spirited', 'backbiting', 'slanderous', 'uncourteous', 'ill-tempered', 'homicidal', 'disrespectful', 'ungrateful', 'denigrating', 'hateful', 'blasphemous', 'rancorous', 'foul-mouthed', 'sneering', 'self-destructive', 'profane', 'belligerent', 'uncivil', 'offensive', 'demeaning', 'unrespectful', 'antagonizing', 'loutish', 'derogatory', 'unkindly', 'spiteful', 'rude', 'niggardly', 'snarling', 'ungentlemanly', 'insubordinate', 'unladylike', 'unkind', 'nasty', 'bigoted', 'violent', 'berating', 'intolerant', 'bullying', 'unbenevolent', 'unwholesome', 'unreasonable', 'destructive', 'inharmonious', 'unappreciative'

Here FFP is characterized by being polite, empathetic, and well-adjusted. The inverse is causing harm to people (including oneself) seemingly for the sake of it. Admittedly, as language is the view from society, this may be biased towards decorum—not making a scene. I had hoped these lists would be a more cut-and-dry description of social intelligence and emotional self-regulation. Nothing pure in this world!

conclusion:

Life is complicated and the FFP is not an unalloyed good in the same way as g. [Brigham Young](https://rsc.byu.edu/firm-foundation/six-days-august-brigham-young-succession-crisis-1844) would not have progeny like [Steve Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTFTmd30tzM) if he were not willing to strong arm his followers into marching into the desert to prepare for the end of the world. You need to break a few eggs to have 50 wives (there are evolutionary reasons that Dark Triad traits are male coded).

Back to personality, we also get some theoretical grounding of FFP by using the Lexical Hypothesis. The sample is from languages spoken by a combined (X billion) people in the world. Far more likely to be general than a sample of 300 mental health patients in Oregon.

Intelligence research has gotten a lot of mileage out of a single general factor: _g_. It explains ~40% of the variance of test data and is more externally valid than any other measure in psychology. Personality research, on the other hand, has several competing general factors derived in different populations, using different instruments, which result in different qualitative descriptions. I suggest unifying this line of research around the First Factor of Personality (FFP) using lexical data.

FFP is the first unrotated factor in general personality. Because it dominates variance in personality data (whether in language, self report, or other report), it can also be identified as the first PC in narrow or clinical surveys, such as those about drug abuse administered to mental health patients. Though important FFP is not _general_. Not all aspects (or factors or nuances) of personality are correlated with it, and several additional factors are required to build a general model of personality. This goes back to the introduction of multiple factor analysis 100 years ago in the seminal Vectors of the Mind. Test data could be explained well by a single factor but personality data required more. Therefore, ‘First’ is a better descriptor.

As a note, it may also be that there are better ways to extract FFP from data, such as network analysis or hierarchical clustering, but for simplicity we will limit ourselves to factor analysis.

#### GFP


Explain that, in general, this is calculated by giving a survey then doing PCA (maybe EFA sometimes?). Whatever comes out as PC1 is dubbed the GFP.

Alpha (and Beta). This uses the same strategy as GFP but the second factor is described as well. To understand the link to general personality, it’s useful to take a step back.

The Big Five are defined by extracting the first five PCs from linguistic data and then applying varimax rotation. Imagine one were to do PCA on a correlation matrix of Big Five word loadings. One would end up with loadings of the original unrotated factors. Instead imagine one created an instrument to approximate the varimax rotated structure (the BFI) and then did PCA on the resulting correlation matrix. One would expect the original factor structure once again (modulo measurement error). 

[do the actual study here. show they are equivalent]

My own research indicates this is the case. Below are the loadings of alpha and beta on each of the five factors, compared to the loadings of PCs 1 and 2 from unrotated NLP data. Alpha and PC1 both load positively on [describe the factors]. Remarkably similar for such different data sources. 

[plot of PCs 1, 2, and alpha/beta correlating to the Big Five.]

Doing PCA on data approximating a varimax rotated space should recapitulate the original unrotated structure. By using factor-level BFI data this confused the relationship to the Lexical Hypothesis and Digman introduced the factors as hierarchically related to the Big Five. Better to deal directly with lexical data when trying to understand factors.

Baar did this in several languages and named PC1 Affiliation. [definition of a Affiliation, emphasize social effectiveness and emotional intelligence. is Affiliation unrotated?] In past post I’ve used the same name to describe PC1 of NLP data.

This may be spilling the beans, but I’ve also been sitting on multilingual results for over a year. Even when factorizing word vectors from 7 languages simultaneously, the first personality factor represents social effectiveness and impulse control. Sociable, charming, patient, affectionate, and tactful vs domineering, abusive, obsessive, compulsive, cowardly and greedy. Or, if you’re more comfortable with Turkish blah blah blah vs blah blah blah. Note that the second factor is also a great match for Beta/Plasticity/Dynamism. Adventurous, creative, impulsive and enthusiastic vs cautious, cowardly and tactful. Why would we stop at one factor?

I’m open with this result because it’s becoming dated to the march of Moore’s law. Other languages should be added (Chinese and Hindi, at least) and it should be properly published. This is large team effort, if you are a personality scientist fluent in a non Indo-European language, please reach out!

[note the code to reproduce this is on my desktop computer. I hope it still runs. Will be a project to get it running on colab.]

These data connect the FFP to the Lexical Hypothesis in multiple languages. They also make it clear that PC1 is not singular. In fact this goes back to why multiple factor analysis was invented in the first place (presented in the seminal Vectors of Mind). One factor is enough to represent test data (_g_). But more are required to represent linguistic data (personality). Hence FFP is a more appropriate name as it does not imply that it is standalone or broad.

Language, the clearest source of personality structure, was obscured by instruments with all sorts of assumptions. The garden of forking paths around GFP produced far more smoke than heat. Too much ink has been spilled trying to understand the Alpha from the point of view of derivative factors. [use one sentence or the other, from the precedding two]

As recently as 2021 the GFP is discussed. (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/spanish-journal-of-psychology/article/is-there-a-meaningful-general-factor-of-personality/7B20E745B32E6D36ED67C3853A67FD18#) Is it a statistical artifact? How does it relate to the Big Five? Both of these are completely answered by the FFP framing. It is not a measurement artifact as it shows up in NLP data as much as survey data. Rather than correlations distributed across the Big Five, it is simply the first factor of an unrotated general model. In this view, it is not a general factor at all. The next several factors contain important personality information.
