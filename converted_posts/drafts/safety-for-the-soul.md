  1. Inside me there are two wolves, Christianity and Existentialism.

  2. Always been drawn to post-war philosophers. There is something about a justified (or at least unavoidable) war with a draft. Your neighbors can vote to send you to hell and die. And that’s the way it must be. Very close to the human condition.

  3. As a missionary losing my faith I secretly read catch 22. Strong identification with Yossarian.

    1. Good thing we force kids to read good literature. I hadn’t liked The Stranger until a realized that you could get used to anything: jail or digging ditches.

  4. On the other hand, there is Tolkein.

    1. It’s not about Jesus really. It’s about transformation and the eventual triumph of good. Gandalf does not save the day, and indeed cannot. That is the role of Frodo and Sam. 

    2. Can’t really defend it, but nothing has ever felt as true.

  5. As I was leaving, Holland beat the drum with “safety for the soul”. It’s an unforced error. The BoM is dumb. But he is onto something. I think that there is a universal need to anchor oneself to infinity. Something that won’t let you down.

    1. Holland tried to make the Christ-story small. I accepted that frame.

  6. Eve Theory of Consciousness implies that there is so much wisdom in ancient stories. We assumed they didn’t know the score because Darwin and Foucault hadn’t come around to really dissect the ideas. But they understand the nature of life, having invented it. 

    1. Has been very healthy for me to see beauty in Christianity. I hope that many injured by religion will feel the same with EToC.

    2. Campbell interview before he dies. “What’s the meaning of life?”

      1. “There’s no meaning.” Then immediately talks about Sacred Marriage and reading as many myths as possible. Elsewhere he talks about feeling as though he were led through life.

  7. I am agnostic, which means being open to there being meaning. Why is there something rather than nothing? No idea. What is consciousness? Also, don’t know. But we may be able to find out
