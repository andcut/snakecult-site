  1. EToC is global. I’ve but in the sweat equity to talk about Christian tradition. Trepidatious to do so with other traditions. Have seen Baptists do so poorly with Mormonism. So take this in the right spirit, me seeing if the story I read into Genesis fits other mythologies more than superficially.

  2. [Shiva, the first Yogi.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0-TVy2aKGE) Many stories of his beginnings. Will use the one from the Shiavism tradition. Sadhguru says he appeared 15,000 years ago in the Himalayas. Looked different, had a different inner life, and taught meditation ot the people. Perfect fit for EToC (quote my first piece, as well as ultraconserved words in Euroasiatic).

    1. Sadhguru on snake venom mixed with milk. Says it killed him, but gave him so much more. Similar to Congo herpetologist who neutralizes a bite with milk. Also similar to the creation story. Shiva churns the cosmic ocean with a snake. This creates poison, but also the drink of immortality. Shiva sacrifices himself, drinking the poison.

    2. He taught 112 ways to achieve enlightenment.

      1. Many involve breathing. Julian Jaynes noted that “to be” and “breathe” share a common PIE root. (though he didn’t bother with pronouns.)

      2. 7 members then taught this to every part of the world.

  3. Spread of shamanism

    1. It really did spread ~15kya.

      1. Along with dogs and genes and maybe “na”

    2. heat comes from spine. Kundalini Yoga is a great example. Said to be a snake going up spine…




"The yogi explored for many years and gave this elaborate knowledge to the world. He then instructed the seven individuals, known as the Saptarishis, to disperse in seven different directions across the globe.

  * One went to Central Asia.

  * Another went to North Africa.

  * Another journeyed to South America.

  * Another went to Southeast Asia.

  * One settled in the Indian part of the Himalayas.

  * One stayed with him.

  * The last one, Agastya, who is very important for us, came down south. He is known as the father of Southern mysticism. Agastya ensured that every single human habitation south of the Vindhyas in the Deccan Plateau had some sense of a spiritual process.




This fundamental possibility evolved from the idea that the yogi instilled in the minds of these seven individuals. He made them thirst for something beyond the limitations of their existence. He instilled a hunger in their hearts to be something more than what is conventionally understood as a human being.

Every creature comes with a framework; ants, tigers, and elephants can do certain things but within that framework. Humans also have a framework, but the yogi introduced the revolutionary idea that you don't have to limit yourself to your dimension. You can transcend it. There is another way, a completely different way to be.

He not only gave this idea but also provided a method to achieve it. This idea—that a human being can strive to evolve beyond the dimension of his present existence—is the basis of this whole civilization and culture. It doesn't matter whether someone identifies as Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh, or anything else; everyone is striving for this one idea: to transcend limitations and attain liberation, or 'mukti.'

This idea of mukti is the centerpiece of our culture. Everything we are doing in this culture aims towards the possibility of transcending all limitations. There has never been a more revolutionary idea on this planet. Since his time, nobody has come up with a more revolutionary idea than this: that you can transcend the very dimension in which you exist."
