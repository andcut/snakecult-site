CHAPTER VIII

THE FALL OF MAN

IN CONNECTION with the creation myths we have

touched on many, tales, in which already at his creation,

man was corrupted by the devil and, therefore, never attained

the perfection which God had intended for him. In the fol¬

lowing we shall see how man, after his creation by God, has

of his own accord drawn disaster on himself.

In most of the tales of this series, man was originally en¬

dowed with a special covering, which protected him from cold,

moisture, wind and other matters liable to affect his health.

Some of the tales provide him with a coat of fur, others with

a nail-substance or horn covering. With the eating of the

forbidden fruit man loses his natural, protective covering.

Very interesting is the following Altaic tale:

A lonely tree grew without branches. God saw it and said:

“ A single, branchless tree is not pleasant to look upon, let

nine branches grow on it.” The nine branches grew on the

tree. God continued: “ Let nine human beings appear under

the nine branches; from the nine human beings nine races.”

Further on in this tale only two people are spoken of, man and

wife, who were at first covered with fur. The name of the

man was Torongoi and of the wife Edji (“ Mother ”). God

said to these people: “Do not eat of the fruit of the four

branches growing towards the sunset, but eat of the five towards

the sunrise.” And God placed a dog under the tree as its

guardian, saying: “ If the devil comes, seize him.” In addi¬

tion he stationed the snake there, saying to it: “If the devil

comes, bite him.” Further, he said to both dog and snake:

“If man comes to eat of the fruit towards the sunrise, let him

approach the tree, but if he wishes to eat of the fruit of the

forbidden branches, do not let him come near.” Having said

which God returned to Heaven.

The devil then arrived at the tree, where he saw the snake,

which had just happened to fall asleep. He crept cunningly

into the snake and with its help climbed the tree, from where

he tempted first the woman and then, through her agency, the

man, to eat of the fruit of the forbidden branches. Having

eaten, the couple see to their astonishment how the hair begins

to fall from their bodies. Ashamed, they hide frightened

behind the tree.

When God came on to the earth and saw what had happened

in his absence, he said to the man: “ How is it with thee? ”

The man replied: “ The woman has pushed into my mouth

the forbidden fruit.” God turned admonishingly to the

woman: “ Why hast thou done this? ” The woman answered:

“The snake tempted me to eat.” God said to the snake:

“Snake, what hast thou done? ” It replied: “Not I, but

the devil who had crept into me tempted her.” God said:

“ How did the devil creep into thee? ” The snake replied:

“ As I slept, the devil arrived.” God turned then to the dog,

saying: “ How was it with thee, why didst thou not drive

away the devil? ” The dog answered: “ Mine eyes saw him

not.”
