“High definition eastern orthodox esoteric image of eve sitting on a coiled serpent like buddha under the Bodhi tree becoming enlightened” w/ ChatGPTIn May, I asked Gemini 1.5 Flash about EToC. It confidently declared:

> “The Eve Theory of Consciousness is credited to Eliezer Yudkowsky, a researcher in artificial intelligence safety. The original idea is quite lengthy, detailed in a blog post on the website LessWrong.” 

Not true! Yudkowsky looked at Sci-Fi and religion and has bet big that the former is a better description of reality. Cutler’s whole schtick is the founding myths are an exquisite exposition of reality.

Flash’s error is informative about how new information is integrated into these silicon summarizers, so I thought I’d compare what the latest models know about EToC. On 12/12/24, I told Grok, Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT to “tell me about the eve theory of consciousness”.

Grok 2 nails it, instantly looking at 15 different sources, mostly from social media (reddit, Hacker News, X). It’s factually accurate and discusses EToC as speculative and interesting.

Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental emphasizes the fringe nature noting authorities are not on board, and there is a considerable lack of evidence. It also gets a couple of details wrong, such as characterizing agriculture as the result of the new female consciousness, when I’ve articulated self-awareness must go back at least to the Venus figurines 40,000 years ago and related the Holocene transition to the spread of rituals that are, as far as we can tell, targeted to men.

Important to remember that a lot of this is random. I asked Gemini 1.5 Flash the same question, and it yields a more sympathetic framing, noting that it’s “new,” “controversial,” and “intriguing.” However, it still falters on the connection to agriculture, saying agriculture → cultural complexity → consciousness.

ChatGPT 4o is completely hallucinatory, discussing a made-up Eve Theory in the most general terms possible. When I reply, “use browse” it does an excellent job synthesizing several articles and podcast appearances.

Claude Sonnet 3.5 (new) correctly knows its limits and says it is not a reliable source on something so obscure.

You can see the different company’s emphasis. Google cares about authority and correct think. Grok is more playful and focuses on more ephemeral sources, which, in the case of a new theory housed on blogs and podcasts is ideal. ChatGPT confidently plows ahead, but does well once it browses. (In hindsight, of course LLMs would be super-human at searching the web.) Claude does the hard thing and says it doesn’t know.

Of course, these general models work best with specific context, either by browsing or manual upload. If any of these models can access my writing, they do an excellent job summarizing the main points. Below are the actual outputs of the models (everything from the first attempt). After each response, I said, “Okay, now make an image that represents the theory”; that image heads each model section.

Where are the accoutrements of consciousness?The Eve Theory of Consciousness (EToC) is a speculative framework that suggests the emergence of human consciousness was closely associated with women, proposing that self-awareness was initially discovered by women and then spread memetically through rituals. Here are the key aspects:

**Historical and Mythological Context**: EToC draws from various sources including Darwinism, the Stoned Ape Theory, Genesis, the Eleusinian Mysteries, and the Rainbow Serpent of Dreamtime. The theory posits that creation myths like the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis are not just allegorical but might reflect an ancient memory of when humans became self-aware. The narrative of Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge is interpreted as a symbolic representation of the advent of consciousness, with the snake playing a role in this transition, possibly through the use of snake venom as an entheogen.**Biological and Cognitive Basis**: According to EToC, recursion in cognitive processes is central to human consciousness, allowing for self-awareness, planning, and introspection. The theory suggests that this recursive capability first emerged between 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, with significant developments continuing into the Holocene. It also theorizes that women might have achieved self-awareness before men, potentially due to different social roles or biological factors, and that this awareness was then taught or spread through rituals which could involve psychedelics like snake venom.**Cultural and Genetic Implications**: The theory argues that once self-awareness was established, it could be taught, leading to cultural shifts and genetic selection for traits supporting stable recursion. This might have influenced human behavior, including migrations out of Africa, the Agricultural Revolution, and the development of complex societies. EToC suggests that cultural practices, including rituals, played a significant role in the diffusion of consciousness, which aligns with the idea that Behavioral Modernity was a regional phenomenon before spreading globally.**Critiques and Considerations**: Critics might question the empirical foundations of EToC, especially since much of it relies on interpretation of myths and speculative connections between biological, psychological, and cultural evolution. The theory's reliance on ancient rituals involving psychedelics or snake venom might also be seen as lacking direct archaeological evidence. However, the interdisciplinary approach of EToC invites further research into how consciousness might have evolved through a blend of genetic predisposition and cultural transmission.In summary, the Eve Theory of Consciousness proposes a fascinating narrative where the development of human consciousness might be linked to women's roles in early human societies, with rituals and possibly psychoactive substances playing a pivotal role in the spread of self-awareness. However, it remains a highly speculative theory that attempts to weave together diverse fields of study into a coherent story of human cognitive evolution.

Flash doesn’t do people, but it made doThe "Eve theory of consciousness" is a fringe and speculative idea that proposes a few controversial notions:

**Recent origin of consciousness:** It suggests that human consciousness, as we know it, is a relatively recent development in human evolution.**Female precedence:** It posits that women developed self-awareness or consciousness before men.**Agricultural link:** It speculates that the development of agriculture was a consequence of this newly emerged female consciousness.These ideas are often linked to interpretations of the biblical story of Adam and Eve, where Eve is seen as the first to gain knowledge and awareness.

**Criticisms and Issues:****Lack of scientific evidence:** There is no scientific evidence from fields like neuroscience, anthropology, or evolutionary biology to support these claims.**Oversimplification of complex processes:** The development of consciousness is a complex process influenced by various biological, environmental, and social factors over long periods. This theory oversimplifies this process.**Potential for gender bias:** The idea of female precedence in consciousness can be interpreted in various ways, some of which can perpetuate gender stereotypes or biases.**In summary:** The Eve theory of consciousness is not a scientifically recognized or widely accepted theory. It lacks empirical support and is considered a fringe idea.It's important to distinguish between such speculative ideas and mainstream scientific research on consciousness, which involves rigorous investigation using various methodologies and evidence-based approaches.

## Gemini 1.5 FlashThe Eve Theory of Consciousness is a relatively new and controversial theory that proposes several intriguing ideas:

**Recent Emergence of Consciousness:** The theory suggests that consciousness is a relatively recent development in human history, emerging within the last few thousand years. This contradicts the traditional view that consciousness has always been a fundamental part of human nature.**Women as First Conscious Beings:** The theory posits that women were the first to develop self-awareness and consciousness. This idea challenges the long-held notion that men have always been the primary drivers of human progress.**Agriculture as a Catalyst:** The theory links the development of agriculture to the emergence of consciousness. It suggests that the shift from hunting and gathering to farming led to increased complexity in human society, which in turn fostered the development of self-awareness.The Eve Theory of Consciousness has been met with both interest and skepticism from the scientific community. Some researchers find the theory intriguing and worthy of further investigation, while others are critical of its lack of empirical evidence and its reliance on speculative claims.

It's important to note that the Eve Theory of Consciousness is not widely accepted by mainstream science. However, it does offer a provocative new perspective on the nature of consciousness and the history of human development.

ChatGPT has always been the best semantic reasoner of the image-generation models.The **Eve Theory of Consciousness** is a conceptual framework within cognitive science and philosophy of mind that explores the origins, structure, and evolution of consciousness. While the term might not represent a universally established theory, it often relates to themes such as the evolutionary emergence of consciousness, the role of social and environmental factors, or metaphorical references to a primal or archetypal "Eve" figure in explaining the origin of human awareness. Below are key aspects commonly associated with discussions that might fall under this framework:1. **Evolutionary Basis**The theory often suggests that consciousness emerged as an adaptive trait in response to evolutionary pressures. This includes:

**Social Cooperation**: Consciousness evolved to enhance social coordination and group survival.**Problem Solving**: The ability to simulate future scenarios, consider multiple outcomes, and make complex decisions.**Self-awareness**: A crucial element for survival, allowing organisms to monitor their internal states and adapt behavior.2. **Primal or Archetypal Origins**The term "Eve" might evoke the idea of a singular or archetypal origin of consciousness:

**Metaphorical Eve**: Suggests a point in evolutionary history where a significant leap occurred, akin to a first "Eve" of conscious beings.**Cultural or Mythological Roots**: Links to narratives about the genesis of human awareness, often tied to myths or symbolic figures.3. **Environmental Influence**Environmental factors, including ecological challenges and resource availability, could have driven the development of higher-order thinking and awareness. This aligns with the hypothesis that consciousness is not solely a genetic or biological phenomenon but also shaped by external forces.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approach**The Eve Theory might draw from multiple disciplines:

**Neuroscience**: Studies how brain structures contribute to conscious experience.**Anthropology**: Examines how human societies have historically developed awareness.**Philosophy**: Engages with the metaphysical and ethical implications of consciousness.5. **Critiques and Alternatives**Critiques of such theories often point out the difficulties in pinpointing the exact origins of consciousness or the potential over-reliance on metaphorical or symbolic representations like "Eve." Alternatives include:

**Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Focuses on quantifying consciousness as integrated information.**Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: Proposes a functional model of how consciousness operates within the brain.The **Eve Theory of Consciousness**, whether explicitly formalized or used as a metaphorical framework, underscores the importance of exploring the origins and mechanisms of conscious thought, bridging science, philosophy, and human narratives. Let me know if you'd like me to delve deeper into any particular aspect!## Then, after I say, “use browse”:The **Eve Theory of Consciousness**, proposed by Andrew Cutler, PhD, a machine learning engineer, explores the origins of human consciousness through the lens of evolutionary psychology, anthropology, and mythology. This theory suggests that consciousness emerged in early human societies, particularly among women, through ritualistic practices involving snake symbolism.**Key Components of the Eve Theory:****Ritualistic Practices and Snake Symbolism:**The theory posits that pre-modern women engaged in rituals centered around snake cults, which played a pivotal role in the development of self-awareness and higher-order thinking. These practices may have facilitated altered states of consciousness, contributing to the evolution of complex cognitive functions.

This cultural diffusion underscores the importance of shared practices in shaping human cognition.

[Vectors of Mind](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**Integration of Mythology and Evolution:**By examining creation myths and symbolic systems, the theory integrates anthropological insights with evolutionary biology to provide a comprehensive understanding of consciousness's origins. This approach highlights the interplay between cultural narratives and cognitive evolution.

## Claude 3.5 (new) SonnetThe Eve Theory of Consciousness is not a widely recognized scientific or philosophical theory - I want to be upfront that I may be unreliable in providing information about such an obscure topic.

Could you clarify what aspects of consciousness theory you're interested in exploring? I'd be happy to discuss well-established theories of consciousness like:

Global Workspace Theory

Integrated Information Theory

Higher-Order Theories

Neural Correlates of Consciousness

Various philosophical approaches like panpsychism or emergentism

Or if you've encountered the "Eve Theory" in a specific context, I'd be interested to hear more about where you came across it so I can better understand what you're looking to learn about.

# Sonnet with access to my collected writingsBased on the documents provided, the Eve Theory of Consciousness (EToC) is a novel theory about the evolution of human consciousness with several key propositions:

Core Claims:

Recursion is the key to human consciousness - specifically, the ability to think "I am" was the first recursive thought that separated humans from animals

Women evolved this capability first, due to evolutionary pressures around social cognition, particularly during pregnancy and childrearing

Self-awareness through recursion spread culturally before becoming genetically fixed

Snake venom played a key role as an entheogen in rituals designed to induce self-awareness

Key Evidence:

Global distribution of snake myths connecting serpents to knowledge, creation, and consciousness

Snake venom contains nerve growth factor and has documented entheogenic properties

Archaeological evidence for ritual snake use dating back to Göbekli Tepe (~12 kya)

Universal myths of women originally possessing sacred knowledge/mysteries that were later taken by men

Cognitive and neurological sex differences in social processing and theory of mind

Genetic evidence of strong selection on brain-related genes in last ~50,000 years

Distribution of pronouns suggesting recent origin of self-reference language

Timeline:

100-50 kya: First sporadic experiences of self-awareness, primarily among women

~50 kya: Development of rituals to induce self-awareness using snake venom

50-12 kya: Spread of these consciousness-inducing rituals globally

12-5 kya: Genetic fixation of recursive abilities, with regional variation

The theory addresses several major puzzles in human evolution:

The "Sapient Paradox" - why fully modern behavior appears so late

Universal myths of a primordial matriarchy

Global prevalence of snake worship and its connection to knowledge

Timing mismatch between anatomically and behaviorally modern humans
