Vectors of Mind is read in 55 countries. I’d like to meet you, but that seems hard at scale. Maybe you can come to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico? This post will explain how I got here and lay out some of the pros and cons. Different type of post, but figure it will interest some. At any rate, open invitation to grab a beer if you’re ever in town.

## How I got here


The plan was to work for a few years after graduation, get established, then experiment with remote work. The pandemic let me try that from the start. In the summer of 2020, in the last year of my Ph.D., I sold all my belongings and booked a flight. It helped that my then-girlfriend-now-wife is from Mexico and had always wanted to live in PDC. Here we are celebrating her birthday that December:

In Boston I was alone in my apartment, listening to sirens collecting the infected, or hooligans set off fireworks night after night. In Mexico I was on the beach with my fiancée, socializing with other escapees. (Mostly crypto maximalists, poker players, breathe-work influencers, and the like; an absolute den of villainy.) Hard to overstate the overnight quality of life improvement. I also graduated and got a job in industry, quadrupling my income. My wife put out the word that PDC was good and within a year four of her friends from college moved into town. They all live within walking distance and drop in on each other like some sort of sitcom. 

Coming from Boston, I went from paying $1100/month to share a two bedroom in a bad part of town to $650/month for an entire 3 bedroom with access to three rarely-used pools:

## Pros/Cons


So for me, Mexico is deeply intertwined with freedom and lust for life. It gave me space to think, which has greatly benefited my writing. After 3 years I have a more complete picture. The positives are fairly obvious, so briefly:

  1. **Mexican culture**. It is so relaxed, concerned with the moment, and doesn’t take itself too seriously. Much effort is spent on food and family, as it should be.

  2. **Weather.** I seriously underrated how nice it is to have sunlight in the winter and to be able to eat outside year-round. 

  3. **Cost of living.** Rent is much cheaper, as is food and labor like house cleaning or bike repair. The best deal I know is a friend who lives 3 minutes from the beach in a modernish 2 bedroom for $1200/month.

  4. **Ease of travel.** Cancun has direct flights all over the world. It’s also in the right time zone for remote work in the US.

  5. **Food.** The world’s best birria tacos are 100 meters from my house. Avocados are basically free at the supermarket.

  6. **Walkable.** You don’t need a car, or even a bike, to get by in PDC. Most things are within a 15-minute walk if you live in the center.

  7. **Fitness culture.** Living on the beach means it’s always bikini season, and the people are ready. In a city of 200k, there are two enormous sports complexes with tracks, tennis courts, and soccer fields. Or come to frisbee practice every Thursday evening on the beach. (Bring beer to share.)

  8. **Unplugging.** My eyes glaze over anytime I read the news. Amazing how fast it was. Knew it was pointless before, but now it seems triply so.




Tuning out the world to chase sunshine, a good exchange rate, and women also has some downsides. It’s certainly boorish when expats optimize a bit too enthusiastically on the package. Maybe spiritually on par with caring a lot about going to a good school. My feeling is there will be problems such as this wherever you live. And I have been relatively insulated from the transient party scene by making friends through sports and my wife. 

The biggest downside to PDC is that the cartel has a violent monopoly on drugs, alcohol, and prostitution, with significant interests in real estate generally. What this means is that any business has to pay “roof” to the cartel, and much more if they serve alcohol. My friend is an architect and they showed up at the construction site, demanding exorbitant amounts of money or the ability to sell drugs from the property (before it was finished, as police would not enter). Awful position to be in. The developer happened to have enough connections he could say no. It actually precipitated a state-wide crackdown, with the national guard being called in to patrol the streets. Obviously having those kinds of government connections is rare.

For the consumer, this mostly means that there is considerable barrier to entry which makes services worse. There was a French-owned dive shop that refused to pay on principle. Cartel shot up their equipment to send a message; they closed shop. Now you have to go to whoever ponies up the fee, even if they are bad at diving.

Crime is an issue. Recently heard a horror story where someone was tailed while driving at 2 am. The bandits popped the tires and the person woke up drugged in the jungle, car and everything else gone. Not exactly sure how to calibrate these stories. I keep a shitty-but-functional bike on my front porch. Hasn’t been stolen in three years, which would surprise me even in the US. So random crime isn’t off the charts, but partiers tend to have trouble late at night.

There are also, surprisingly, some high costs. I find myself conserving electricity because they have a weird system where you have to pay 3x as much if you use more than a certain amount. Shopping in general is much easier in the US. Many products on Amazon are 30% more here, and there are fewer factory outlets or thrift shops (though part of that is being in a city small enough to walk across).

## Come say hi


PDC is a great place for a vacation. Good weather, good people, and tons to do. If you’re doing the Digital Nomad thing it’s great for a stint, or as a home base. Either way, say hi if you are ever in town.
