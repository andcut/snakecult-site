We are going through a technological revolution. So many more people with access to such better tools. More science written in the last decade than all of the 20th century (made this up, but I’m sure it’s true by some metric). This deluge tends to bury ideas from the past. Further, there is a cultural revolution trying to do just that. Much research exists primarily to problematize past thinkers and their ideas. Imagine the protests if Darwin were a professor today.

[This need not be reactionary. Consider iglesias/shor tweet about learning from the ancients (90s political operatives)]

As such, I suggest a good way to contribute to knowledge is to acquaint yourself with new tools and old theories. That has been my path. PhD in electrical engineering researching natural language processing. Following this, I added to Galton’s lexical hypothesis, Jayne’s theory of bicameral mind, and Thurstone’s factor analysis. Much easier work than having any such clever ideas myself. When standing on the shoulders of giants, find a tall one rather than a recent one.

It would be very helpful to have a list of the top 10 most influential ideas in each decade. For a single field, even a single idea per decade would be a lot to go off of. I wonder if such a catalogue exists. Would be an excellent place for ambitious young researchers to start.
