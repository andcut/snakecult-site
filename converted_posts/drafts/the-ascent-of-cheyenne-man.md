Migration + Ascent of Man: https://archive.org/details/mythologyofall10gray/page/126/mode/2up?view=theater

VII. MIGRATION-LEGENDS AND YEAR-COUNTS

The historical sense had reached a certain development among the Indians of the Plains as among those of the east. Not only are migration-legends to be found, such as that of the Creek, but pictographic records, like the Walum Olum of the Delaware, are possessed by more than one western tribe.

Among the most interesting of these migration-traditions — interesting because of their analogies with similar legends of the civilized Mexican peoples — are the Cheyenne myths reported by G. A. Dorsey. The tales begin with an origin story,^^ telling how, in the beginning, the Great Medicine created the earth and the heavenly bodies; and, in the far north, a beautiful country, an earthly Paradise where fruits and game were plentiful, and where winter was unknown. Here the first people lived on honey and fruits; they were naked, and wandered about like the animals with whom they were friends; they were never cold or hungry. There were three races of these men: a hairy race; a white race, with hair on their heads; and the Indians, with hair only on the top of the head. The hairy people went south, where the land was barren, and after a time the Indians followed them; the white, bearded men also departed, but none knew whither. Before the red men left this beautiful country, the Great Medicine blessed them and gave them that which seemed to awaken their dormant minds, for hitherto they had been without Intelligence. They were taught to clothe their bodies with skins and to make tools and weapons of flint.

The red men followed the hairy men to the south, where the latter had become cave-dwellers. These, however, were afraid of the Indians, were few In number, and eventually disappeared. Warned of a flood which was to cover the southland, the Indians returned to the north, to find that the bearded men and some of the animals were gone from there. Nor were they able, as before, to talk with the animals, but they tamed the panther and bear and other beasts, teaching them to catch game for the people. Afterward they went once more to the south, where the flood had subsided, and where the land was become beautiful and green. Another Inundation came, however, and scattered them here and there in small bands, so that they never again were united as one people. This deluge laid the country waste, and to escape starvation they journeyed north once more, only to find the lands there also barren. After hundreds of years, the earth shook, and the high hills sent forth fire and smoke; with the winter came floods, so that all the red men had to dress In furs and live In caves, for the winter was long and cold, and It destroyed all the trees. The people were nearly starved when spring came; but the Great Medicine gave them maize to plant and buffalo for meat, and after that there were no more famines.

A second myth of the same people, which is In some degree a doublet of the preceding, tells how the ancestors of the Cheyenne dwelt in the far north, beyond a great body of water. They were overpowered by an enemy and In danger of becoming slaves, when a medicine-man among them, who possessed a marvellous hoop and carried a long staff, led them from the country. On the fourth night of their journey, they saw before them a bright light, a little above the ground, and this went In front of them as they advanced. When they came to the water, the medicine-man told them that he was going to lead them to a land where they should live forever. He sangmagic songs; the waters divided; and the people crossed ondry land. The fire now disappeared, and when day came theyfound themselves in a beautiful country.

In these events the missionary influence is obvious: theExodus of Israel is adapted to Cheyenne history. The storygoes on, however, with elements that seem truly aboriginal. In the new country the Cheyenne were physically strong, but mentally weak. They could carry off large animals on theirbacks; they tamed the bear and the panther. Animals, too,were huge. One variety was in the form of the cow, thoughfour times as large; it was tame by nature, and men used Itsmilk; twenty men and boys could get upon the back of one ofthese creatures at a time. Another species resembled the horse,but had horns and long, sharp teeth; this was a man-eater,and could trail human beings through the rivers and tall grassby scent; fortunately, beasts of this kind were few In number.Most of the animals were destroyed in a great flood, afterwhich the Cheyenne who survived were strong In mind, butweak In body.

It Is tempting to see in these stories vague memories of great physlographical changes, reaching back perhaps to theglacial age, and to the period when the elephant kind wasabundant in North America, and the great sabre-tooth notyet extinct. On the other hand, the northerly and southerlywanderings of the tribe may well be historical, for It Is altogether in keeping with what Is known of the drift of the tribalstocks; naturally, such migrations In search of food would beaccompanied by changes In the conditions of life. In faunaand in flora.
