So far in the series of consciousness the posts have skewed grand and sprawling. This is a welcome reprieve (at least for me), in that it’s relatively straightforward.

  1. Everyone agrees that we don’t know what caused the Agricultural Revolution

  2. The Greeks and Jews say it was a consequence of discovering the human condition

  3. The dates and mechanism check out, could be




This post draws from economics, archeology, and autoentheogenic studies. But thankfully we spend most of our time in the classics: _Works and Days_ , _The Epic of Gilgamesh_ , _Genesis_.

## Previously on Vectors of Mind


  1. **Eve Theory of Consciousness**. Genesis (and other creation myths) are memories of the emergence of the mind-body problem. Women were conscious first, and they inducted men in mind-bending rituals.

  2. **Snake Cult of Consciousness**. These rituals used snake venom as a psychedelic to help initiates have this realization. This is why snakes are so commonly associated with creation, knowledge and rebirth.

  3. **Unreasonable Effectiveness of Pronouns**. We have had a word for “I” since we became self-aware; by tracking the spread of the first person singular, we can track the spread of consciousness. For decades linguists have noticed that most proto-languages use “n” in the 1sg. I argue that the distribution is admissible evidence in understanding the Sapient Paradox.




Notably, this line of reasoning came out of my work in psychometrics. I was minding my own business, trying to explain the [General Factor of Personality](https://vectors.substack.com/p/primary-factor-of-personality-part) to a general audience. For years I had understood it to be an evolutionary force because it was derived from natural language. Another way to view it is as the principle component of gossip, which Darwin himself said was the primary fitness factor on humans. I then speculated that [selection in that direction would be selection for a conscience](https://vectors.substack.com/p/consequences-of-conscience), and that the first inner voice may have functioned to deliver these pro-social commands. This idea was quite popular, no pushback.

To relate this pre-self inner voice to our own, I tried to imagine the transition. What got me into trouble was when I realized I could do no better than _Genesis_. Before the mind-body split, we would have lived in Eden, at one with nature and the gods. Self-awareness rends this world. The role of the gods, internal agents understanding good and evil, is subsumed in this new entity: _I_. It was the original [infohazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard#:~:text=An%20information%20hazard%2C%20or%20infohazard,or%20contained%20in%20Information%20sensitivity.). We could not stay having seen the man behind the curtain.

As you can imagine, this was less popular. Who am I to speak of consciousness? And especially to bring in the Bible like some young earth creationist. But it plausibly follows from the General Factor of Personality! It’s reasonable that we did not identify with the first inner voice. It’s reasonable that someone in this state could realize they produce the inner voice. It’s reasonable that women would do that first, and agriculture would result. It’s reasonable that story would survive 12,000 years. It’s reasonable that psychedelics were involved, and that snake venom would be the first we experiment with given its tendency to find us.

I realize that stacking these together seems unlikely. But widely accepted explanations strike me as impossible. Chomsky, for example, thinks that recursion (full language) is coded by a single gene that fell out of the sky in Africa 50-100k years ago. Direct evidence of recursion then emerged 10k years later, on another continent. There were no subsequent adaptations that modified psychology in any important ways in response to entering this new niche. This is so fanciful that archeologists had to come behind him with the Sapient Paradox: “If we were fully modern 50k years ago, why wasn't sapient behavior global until ~12k years ago?”

I say, looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck. We should at least entertain the possibility that consciousness spread after our migration Out of Africa. The phenomenology of _Genesis_ is compelling, but subjective experience is outside the realm of archeology. The sedentary life, however, leaves marks. We can test whether agriculture could be a result of being kicked out of the metaphorical garden. 

## Agricultural Revolution


 _“In the spring of 2011, 25 scholars with a central interest in domestication representing the fields of genetics, archaeobotany, zooarchaeology, geoarchaeology, and archaeology met at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center to discuss recent domestication research progress and identify challenges for the future. In this introduction to the resulting Special Feature, we present the state of the art in the field…”_([source](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1323964111))

What strikes me is that they could get 25 people with diverse research agendas to agree with:

_“At least 11 regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin, encompassing geographically isolated regions on most continents, but several more have been suggested.”_

[ *[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OG4j!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b03657-4dcf-468e-ba69-6f1de831577a_700x374.png)

Agriculture was invented independently 11 times! Our species goes back 100-[300k](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao6266) years. This means that billions of humans did not invent agriculture. Then, all over the world, at roughly the same time, many cultures independently made the leap. What could have caused this?

_“Traditionally, the transition to agriculture was viewed as the result of a few single agents or “prime movers” that operated at the onset of the Holocene. Climate change, human population pressure, and culturally driven alternatives, such as “competitive feasting,” are among numerous additional agents proposed by generations of archaeologists.”_

There are not many questions that have withstood so much scientific scrutiny. And still, after all these decades, the answer is “we really don’t know…competitive fasting?” It seems as though the answer must be global, which makes climate change compelling. This is right after the Ice Age, after all. (Remember ice was also used to motivate the spread of _na_ in Euroasiatic. Academics love answers that center climate change.) But then the argument is that it was too cold in Mexico, Peru, and the Middle East? These places were far from glaciers, even at the peak of the Ice Age. Further, the climate has changed a lot over the last 300k years. What made this time different?

I think that self-awareness contains the seed of agriculture. For it brings death anxiety, planning, and private property. Wherever self-awareness spread, humans invariably exerted their nascent will over useful plants and animals. Often, this resulted in wholesale adoption of the agricultural lifestyle.

### Why pick up the plow?


“ _You people go to all that trouble, working and planting seeds, but we don't have to do that. All these things are there for us, the Ancestral Beings left them for us. In the end, you depend on the sun and the rain just the same as we do, but the difference is that we just have to go and collect the food when it is ripe. We don't have all this other trouble._ ” ~[Aboriginal woman](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Chapter+2+origin+of+agriculture+and+the+domestication+of+plants-a0183140780) to a Fijian missionary

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUZg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fmissing-image.png)

Or, in the words of the [Little Red Hen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen): _“Who will help me plant the wheat? Who will help me make the bread? Who will help me eat the bread?”_ In addition to being a whole lot of work, we know that the first farmers [died shorter and were more prone to disease.](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/05/13/183710778/why-humans-took-up-farming-they-like-to-own-stuff) So why did people so consistently turn to agriculture? One theory is the invention of private property.

_Familiar explanations of why hunter-gatherers first took up farming—superior labor productivity, population pressure, or adverse climate—receive little support from recent evidence. Farming would be an unlikely choice without possession-based private property, which appears to have existed among rare groups of sedentary hunter-gatherers who became the first farmers. Our model shows that among them, farming could have benefited first adopters because private possession was more readily established and defended for cultivated crops and domesticated animals than for the diffuse wild resources on which hunter-gatherers relied, thus explaining how farming could have been introduced even without a productivity advantage.[The Neolithic Agricultural Revolution and the Origins of Private Property | Journal of Political Economy: Vol 127, No 5](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/701789) _

That is, farming could have been adopted even if it wasn’t efficient as long as it made it easier to reap what you sow. Of course, this requires the notion of private property which works better with a sense of self. As Jaynes says:

> _In the bicameral era, the bicameral mind was the social control, not fear or repression or even law. There were no private ambitions, no private grudges, no private frustrations, no private anything, since bicameral men had no internal ‘space’ in which to be private, and no analog to be private with._ ~The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind

I’ve done some, uh, _autoethnographic_ , research on the topic. A few years back I was tripping on shrooms in a mountain cabin. Time stopped, the universe gobbled me up, and I ran around thinking I was an NPC in a video game. It was ego death, but not in a “see god” kind of way. I was content as a husk, reciting my lines. This still felt like hacking the system. Each minute dragged on for hours—an eternity I got to spend with my friends. One was calling forth figures on a sketch pad. These came to life in front of me, wheeling with delight around the edges of the paper—staring back, waving.

While high, my phone took on a very different character. How could an object be mine if I don’t exist? I knew intellectually that it should be “mine” but the concept seemed laughable. With a properly functioning ego, we naturally form a strong attachment to the little box that connects us to the social and financial world. If you chemically turn off the self, a phone retains its abilities (eg. blasting Pink Floyd), but your ownership goes up in smoke. These aren’t _just_ high thoughts. As psychedelics can shut down the ego, they are also a [useful model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007152/) in the study of self.

A self extends our natural instincts. Animals can be afraid. Humans have honed this into nail-biting anxiety. Dogs have a basic notion of property (just try to take your dog's favorite toy). This impulse, particularly, would have been extended by ego.

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Do95!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d6293c2-66fa-4901-8cc0-a705eb2f3cb5_1024x1024.png)This has been “Autoethnography without the Auto”, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Additionally, the invention of self is the invention of the death of self. Hunter-gatherers spend an enormous amount of time idle. (Though that of course is a simplification. [Jung thought very highly of Australian Aborigines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU2xCWZTlbw) who he said spent most of their time immersed in the collective unconscious.) After the discovery of self the neurotically inclined may have filled this space with visions of starvation next winter. With the concomitant increase in planning ability, one could find low-risk low-reward activities to hedge against future starvation. It was the try-hards willing to grind (millet).

There is a more mathematical angle to this. Self-awareness requires recursion. What is aware of the self? Well, the self. To perceive itself, the self must receive its own state as input; recursion by definition. There is a literature that says that mental time travel (thinking of the future) requires recursion (see Michael Corballis’ [The Recursive Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Recursive-Mind-Origins-Language-Civilization/dp/0691160945)). So once we get recursive thinking we get the ability to think of starving next winter as well as the ability to flexibly avoid that. This is different from birds preparing for the winter by flying south. Instincts are hard-wired over millions of years. They don’t pop up independently over the course of a few thousand years as agriculture did.

Any way you slice it, the human condition (recursive language, recursive self-awareness, mind-body duality, etc) could plausibly result in agriculture. Importantly, this isn’t necessarily the result. Obviously one could become conscious and then choose to live as a hunter-gatherer. For example, the coasts of Australia have been inhabited for >50,000 years, but not the arid interior. This was [only settled during the Holocene](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128661), coinciding with the emergence of complex societies and the Rainbow Serpent. Like the Agricultural Revolution writ large, the linked paper explains this expansion with climate change. Amazingly, there is an entire [dissertation](http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/13981/) that argues that initiation rites were key to the expansion. More on that in another post.

## Cursed to toil


[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D348!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1de6f594-e401-4cb3-b3d3-68621ea4df51_367x500.png)[Mid 12th century Italian mural](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/biteintheapple/leaving-home/)

It is not at all a new idea that our establishment as Thinking Man produced agriculture. Many cultures teach the same thing. After Adam eats the Fruit of Knowledge he becomes like God, knowing good and evil. Not one to be disobeyed, Yahweh casts him out of the Garden:

> _Cursed is the ground because of you;_
> 
> _With hard labor you shall eat from it_
> 
>  _All the days of your life._
> 
> _…_
> 
>  _By the sweat of your face_
> 
>  _You shall eat bread_

[Likewise, in Africa](https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/fall) we see the themes of women, agriculture and a Fall:

> _In a Dogon myth from Mali, heaven and earth were originally very close to each other. But God separated them and made men mortal, after being disturbed by the noise of the women crushing millet._

### The Epic of Gilgamesh


The Eve Theory of consciousness centers the best known story in the world. I could have just as well used the oldest story recorded to come to the same idea. Written 4,000 years ago, the first conflict in the [Epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh) is with Enkidu, a man still living as a beast.

> _This Enkidu was innocent of mankind._
> 
> _He knew not the cultivated land._
> 
> _Enkidu ate grass in the hills with the gazelle_
> 
>  _Jostled with wild beasts at the water-holes;_

Like a wolf among the flock, this caused problems for civilized trappers who competed for the same game. One afflicted hunter asks his king to help.

> _“Gilgamesh spoke to him, to the hunter,_
> 
> _"Go, hunter, lead forth the harlot Shamhat,_
> 
> _And when he approaches the cattle at the watering place,_
> 
> _She must take off her clothes and reveal her attractions._
> 
> _He will see her and go close to her._
> 
> _Then his cattle, who have grown up in open country with him, will become_
> 
>  _alien to him."_

After being led to the watering hole:

> _“Shamhat loosened her undergarments, opened her legs and he took in her attractions._
> 
> _She did not pull away. She took wind of him,_
> 
> _Spread open her garments, and he lay upon her._
> 
> _She did for him, the primitive man, as women do._
> 
> _His love-making he lavished upon her._
> 
> _For six days and seven nights Enkidu was aroused and poured himself into Shamhat._

Satisfied, he returns to the wild but finds that he cannot keep pace with the animals. He grows weary when he runs and animals scatter when they see him. Shamhat explains his alienation.

> _You have become wise Enkidu, you have**become like a god**._
> 
> _Why should you roam open country with wild beasts?_

### Pandora’s box


Somehow, Hesiod manages a more dismal view of women than Genesis. Whereas Yahweh created Eve as a helpmeet for Adam, Zues sent Pandora as a curse. In _[The Theogeny](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm)_ Hesiod describes the female kind as a “ _deadly race who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble, no helpmeets in hateful poverty, but only in wealth.”_ He then waxes eloquent about bees who stay at the hive getting fat off the labors of others _“—even so Zeus who thunders on high made women to be an evil to mortal men_.” Not sure what to say, maybe he was recently divorced.

In Genesis the command not to eat the fruit is capricious, only justified “because I said so”. Likewise, the consequence enforced by Yahweh. For the Greeks, the pain of living is a natural consequence of the gift of life (Pandora = all-gifts, reminiscent of Eve’s moniker, mother of all living). Hesiod’s telling in [Works and Days](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/works.htm) offers some hints about agriculture. Pandora is sent as a “ _a plague to men who eat bread_ ”:

> _But he [Epimetheus] took the gift, and afterwards, when the evil thing was already his, he understood. For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth**remote and free from ills** and hard toil [as hunter-gatherers?] and heavy sickness which bring the Fates upon men; for in misery men grow old quickly. But the woman took off the great lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and the sea is full. Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; **for wise Zeus took away speech from them**. So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus. ~_Hesiod: Works And Days, translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White (1914), bolding and brackets my own

I find it significant that Pandora is associated with bread, that before receiving her gifts men lived remote and carefree, and that Zeus took away speech from what plagues men. I’m way outside my expertise, but a plausible reading is that the introduction of the human condition resulted in agriculture. About the voices, in line with Jaynes’ _Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_ or _Genesis_ , this transition also included the dissolution of guiding voices. Man now lived by his own devices.

Men earned the curse of Pandora though the actions of the Prometheus (literally, Forethought) who stole fire from Zeus to give to Man. To Hesiod, Forethought destroyed the race of man in their [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age)

[^1]:

> _First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of Cronos when he was reigning in heaven. And they lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint._

No fear of death or the need to work for food? This state was disrupted by the acquisition of knowledge? I’ve heard that story before.

## The horror of knowing


At the end of the _Epic of Gilgamesh_ the secret to immortal life is discovered, only to have it snatched away by a serpent. Pandora’s forbidden knowledge is also depicted next to snakes. The etching below was produced by a Christian, so arguably this symbol is a loan. Still, notice the fortitude it takes to stare into the abyss.

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4MDc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21dabc53-0858-4207-9a9a-7cbf8a006d5b_586x900.jpeg)Pandora featured in The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit, 1557, an etching ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro. As in Eden, a snake is next to the forbidden knowledge.

In the original Hebrew of Genesis _their eyes were opened_ is more forceful. If Eve was as Pandora, willing her own sight, then Adam was more like:

[*[Image: Visual content from original post]*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6tDT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c7dfc35-8304-4ae4-b4ac-3609af8c01e0_1200x720.jpeg)Adam, obtaining the wisdom of the gods

These accounts are very obviously the male perspective. Women discovered the human condition, _and that’s a bad thing_. This lends credence to the idea that women actually imparting some knowledge. Even stories that condemn them for it admit the gift. 

There must have been terror in the realization. Even so, maligning the event is probably “recent” Sky-Father propaganda, layered on in the Bronze Age. Some scholars see continuity of serpents and female-led second births back to the Ice Age. The [Mal'ta–Buret' culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%27ta%E2%80%93Buret%27_culture) existed 24-15k BP around lake Baikal in present-day Russia. This people contributed significant ancestry to the Native Americans, Siberians, and Eurasian steppe peoples such as the [Yamnaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamna_culture). Like contemporary European cultures, they made Venus Statues. In the burial of a 4 year old boy, archeologists found a gold mine of artifacts including preserved DNA, and cobras engraved on mammoth tusks. Joseph Campbell sums up the burial and culture in [The Masks of God](https://archive.org/details/masksofgod00camp_0/page/331): 

> _“We are clearly in a paleolithic province where the serpent, labyrinth, and rebirth themes already constitute a symbolic constellation, joined with the imagery of the sunbird and shaman flight, with the goddess in her classic role of[protectress of the hearth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia), mother of man's second birth, and [lady of wild things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potnia_Theron) and of the food supply.”_

## Conclusion


From the moment we first experienced mind-body duality a reasonable response would have been: “Holy shit! What is this?”. I have not thought deeply about consciousness until recently. Perhaps revealing my naiveté, but it’s shocking how sophisticated the answers are in humanity’s earliest treatments: _Genesis_ , Greek myths, the _Rigveda_ , the Navajo Emergence Myth. These are not simply of historical interest; they are still relevant to understand our place in nature today. If we could go back to the burial of the Mal’ta boy I think we would find the same. There would be English words to translate his ritualized interment; they are people with whom we could have a dialogue.

Of course, these myths make other claims. Some of them theological, such as whether there is one god or many. Others anatomical, such as Eve coming from Adam’s rib. How can we pick and choose what could be real? Well, there is no open question about the relation of women to ribs and the mechanism is suspect. On the other hand, self-awareness is arguably a pre-requisite for inventing agriculture, and we have no explanation for when self-awareness emerged or why agriculture was invented around the world at roughly the same time. 

My position is that these myths put forth a _plausible_ story about the agricultural revolution. Claiming that is impossible strikes me as more fantastic. We can be pretty sure there were enormous lifestyle and therefore psychological changes about 12,000 years ago. Why should we expect time to completely expunge the story from our traditions? And some experts don’t! For example, [this clip](https://youtu.be/81MmuRrq1rg?t=167) argues that The Navajo creation myth is among the oldest in the world because the active role of women may hearken back to the Venus statues of the Ice Age. What then of Eve or Pandora? And what of the beginning of the human condition?

This post takes its title from a 1994 book ([The Birth of Gods and the Origins of Agriculture](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/397144)) which argues the agricultural revolution was caused by the symbolic revolution that preceded it. Chauvin holds that there was a "restructuring of human mentality from the thirteenth to the tenth millennium BC, expressed in terms of new religious ideas and symbols"[^2]. It was a treatise against the view that progress in the Malthusian regime was dominated by material concerns. So, millennia after the world’s creation myths were transcribed, scientists joined the chorus recognizing that Man does not live by bread alone, _“but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”_

It’s _weird_ how agriculture springs up across the globe at the beginning of the Holocene. We have no explanation. It’s weird that [most proto-languages use “n” in the first person singular](https://vectors.substack.com/p/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of). As noted in the Sapient Paradox, it’s weird how little production of culture there is, and then it takes off like a rocket, starting with religion. The spread of consciousness can explain all of this in one fell swoop. This is what the myths indicate, at least. We became as the gods, the animals became alien, and we had to work to live.

Taking the Sapient Paradox seriously requires huge updates to who we are where we came from. If a baby now has the same potential as a baby 50,000 years ago, we must accept that in some different environment we would not produce art, tell stories, invent, or question what it all means. I don’t think that’s right. Given the archeological and linguistic evidence, we should look at the creation myths with fresh eyes. Maybe the materialist approach threw the baby out with the bathwater.

I’ll keep plugging along making the case that self-awareness is recent, and myths tell of that transfiguration. It helps to have feedback (critical or not), so leave a comment.

Relevant passage from Birth of the Gods that describes the diffusion of the Mother Goddess and her bull consort:“A significant development resulted, and it was of a psychological nature. We have characterized it as a new distinction at the heart of the human imagination between and ‘above’ and a ‘below’, between an order of a divine force, personified and dominant, and that of an everyday humanity whose internal striving towards this perfect, transcendent being may be symbolized by the upraised arms of the supplicant. As universal Mother, The Goddess is well provided with explicitly ‘royal’ attributes…”To be a species pedant, it is true that the bull is an important Near-Eastern religious symbol, but it plays fourth fiddle to snakes at Gobekli Tepe, which is the archeological lynchpin of any theory of religion and agriculture.For a review of Cauvin’s work see Ritual and Thought: Spirituality and Method in Philosophy of Religion
