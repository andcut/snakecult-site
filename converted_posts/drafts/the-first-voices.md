I’d like to add a third postulate to Galton’s Lexical Hypothesis:

Those personality characteristics that are important to a group of people will eventually become a part of that group's language.

More important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word.

**The primary latent factor of trait adjectives represents the direction of social selection that made us human.**Remember from the previous post that the Primary Factor of Personality can be summed up as the Golden Rule. That it should play a role in our evolution is actually a reframing of an observation made by Galton’s cousin, Darwin. 

*After the power of language had been acquired, and the wishes of the community could be expressed, the common opinion of how each member ought to act for the public good, would naturally become in a paramount degree the guide to action. ~*The Descent of Man

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Inside you there are two apesThe previous post argued that the primary factor of personality can be summed up as the Golden Rule: do unto others what you would have them do unto you. It is a description of what creatures dependent on a complex society are encouraged to become. This dependence is baked into our bodies. Our weak jaws and digestive track that requires cooked food. Our neotenous faces. We live by the good graces of others. 

It’s also baked into our outsized brains. Our long development period and unparalleled ability to communicate. Our need to join a group. And our conscience, the voice of society in our heads. Darwin continues:

*I fully subscribe to the judgement of those writers who maintain that of all the differences between man and the lower animals, the moral sense or conscience is by far the most important.*This post argues that outer speech was first internalized as a proto-conscience—“an inward monitor [that] would tell the animal it would have been better to have followed the one impulse rather than the other”. (Descent of Man, again.) We dwell on the forces that placed internal speech inside our heads, and speculate about it’s prehistorical nature.

## What is internal speech?I have so far used the terms conscience, inner voice and becoming ‘human’. All these entail something like *consciousness*, which is of course dangerous territory. Despite universal experience in the arena, the brightest minds over millennia have not been able to agree on a definition. I appreciate Julian Jaynes *description *of being conscious.*O’ what a world of unseen visions and heard silences, this insubstantial country of the mind! What ineffable essences, these touchless rememberings and unshowable reveries! And the privacy of it all! A secret theater of speechless monologue and prevenient counsel, an invisible mansion of all moods, musings, and mysteries, an infinite resort of disappointments and discoveries. A whole kingdom where each of us reigns reclusively alone, questioning what we will, commanding what we can. A hidden hermitage where we may study out the troubled book of what we have done and yet may do. An introcosm that is more myself than anything I can find in a mirror. This consciousness that is myself of selves, that is everything, and yet nothing at all一 what is it? **And where did it come from? **And why?*Julius Jaynes, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind

Inner speech constitutes a subset of this experience. How close to the whole? Jaynes takes an aggressive tack. All that is introspectable, he claims, relies on language. Before we harnessed thinking using language we were ‘automatons’, unable to introspect. No need to get hung up on the totality of his vision. Could we ruminate before we could speak? Before we could speak internally? I’m not sure. For this post, it’s sufficient that the human condition is much different with an inner voice.

## The variety of voicesTo gain insight to the beginning, let’s first look to the many modern forms. 

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Our inner dialogue can model many points of viewThere is significant variation in how much time people spend with an active inner voice. For example, see responses to these [popular](https://twitter.com/KylePlantEmoji/status/1221713792913965061) [tweets](https://twitter.com/Luvvie/status/1223046582268039168). Or, as one person without an inner voice [describes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/inner-monologue-experience-science-1.5486969):*Rivera said not having an inner monologue has been good for her in some ways, because she can block out negative memories or thoughts relatively easily. **It also brought some challenges. She said that when she was growing up, her mother often told her to think before she spoke, but she couldn't. **"*I can be blunt and I can have no filter. Sometimes I say things I shouldn't say,*" she said. "*People often know what I'm thinking because I will say exactly what I'm thinking.*"*Basically what you’d expect, less rumination but also limited social grace. Though our inner voice can be our harshest critique, most people manage a healthy relationship. 

A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744794/) in Norway found that 7.3% of the general population report having auditory hallucinations. Only a fairly small fraction (16%) consider it something to see a doctor about. Worldwide there is significant cultural variation in how we interpret voices, even those that may be classified as schizophrenic. For example [Nga Whakawhitinga (standing at the crossroads): How Maori understand what Western psychiatry calls ‘‘schizophrenia’’](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363461518757800) includes some interviews.*For me hearing voices is like saying hello to your whanau [family] in the morning it is nothing unusual.* (CSW)*My understanding of that is that I absolutely accept that if someone tells me that they see someone standing in the room that I can’t see that there actually is. They actually can see it. I understand that*. (KAU/MAN). *They come to me when things are about to get bad... they sometimes tell me what to do and if I do it then I get through. I used to think them coming meant I was going crazy again but now I realize that when times were tough, they were there to help me through. (TW) Yep a lot of them have something that needs to be done. You will know when you’re supposed to do it, they’re not subtle, they will show you what you need to do and they won’t stop until you do it.* (TW)# The first voicesLiving the Golden Rule requires theory of mind. “In their situation, how would *I* like to be treated?” Producing speech at all also requires theory of mind [cite]. Together there must have been enormous pressure on the ability. Molecular biology provides some clues to how that may have happened in [Interrogating the Evolutionary Paradox of Schizophrenia (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full):Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder with a worldwide prevalence of ∼1%. The high heritability and reduced fertility among schizophrenia patients have raised an evolutionary paradox: why has negative selection not eliminated schizophrenia associated alleles during evolution?

…

In [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#F4), we offer a simple preliminary framework that integrates our results within an evolutionary context. Our framework adopts the by-product hypothesis’ notion that the number of schizophrenia risk alleles increased with the development of the social brain, language, and high-order cognitive functions ([Crow, 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B7); [Burns, 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B4)). Aligned with this notion, we speculate that around 100,000 – 150,000 years ago ([Burns, 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B4)), before the migration of modern humans out-of-Africa ([Stringer and Andrews, 1988](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B23)), there was a “turning point” at which time the number of schizophrenia risk alleles plateaued. Thereafter, risk alleles for schizophrenia have been progressively but slowly eliminated from the modern human genome while undergoing negative selection pressure.

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

GWAS is still young and the authors give many caveats. But this timeline both explains the population genetics of schizophrenia and aligns with a plausible commencement of inner speech. 

**Language requires theory of mind. The genes that accomplish this, at a certain threshold, also produce auditory hallucinations. When there was no inner voice, theory of mind / schizophrenia alleles were under positive selection. Once auditory hallucinations became a phenotype—roughly 100k years ago, sometime after the development of language—there was selection against hallucinations.** For infrequent and fit hallucinations (eg. giving good advice). As well as for a mind that readily accepts an agentic cultural understanding of these voices. These characteristics are now captured by the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia.Note this is different from saying that everyone back then was schizophrenic. Schizophrenia includes a [general disruption of self-processing and self-demarcation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.570570/full), including [autoimmune dysfunction](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imm.12795). The argument here is that there was selection for parts of schizophrenia until quite recently, around the time internal voices may have began. My guess is the capability did not spring forth operating like our well-oiled internal dialogue. It had to start small and simple.[worded differently: As humans came to rely on language and cooperation there was strong selection for better theory of mind, including genes that contribute to schizophrenia. Past a certain threshold these modeled minds took on a life of their own and we began to hallucinate. At this point there was selection against the deleterious aspects of TOM that correlate with a modern schizophrenia diagnosis, (though still strong selection for TOM in general). The turning point must not have been so long ago, as ~1% of the world has schizophrenia. Many who don’t meet diagnostic criteria hear voices.]

## What were the voices like?In this timeline, we imagine that selection for language and theory of mind produced auditory hallucinations. As such, they would be the demands of society brought to life as a voice in our head. Essentially, how to conform and be a good teammate. “Patience! Share! Make eye contact!”

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

For good or ill, gods spoke not so long agoOne can also imagine voices urging “lie! cheat! steal! kill!”, but these behaviors are more complex to make work when interacting with the [same 50 players](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/004724849290081J) your entire life. As Darwin said, for humans reciprocal altruism is the name of the game. The first voices would have suggested a simple strategy, we developed the devil on our shoulder later.In general, the voices insisted on whatever society prescribes. Descent of Man includes an interesting case where duty misfires.

*Dr. Landor acted as a magistrate in West Australia, and relates, that a native on his farm, after losing one of his wives from disease, came and said that, "he was going to a distant tribe to spear a woman, to satisfy his sense of duty to his wife. I told him that if he did so, I would send him to prison for life. He remained about the farm for some months, but got exceedingly thin, and complained that he could not rest or eat, that his wife's spirit was haunting him, because he had not taken a life for hers. I was inexorable, and assured him that nothing should save him if he did." Nevertheless the man disappeared for more than a year, and then returned in high condition; and his other wife told Dr. Landor that her husband had taken the life of a woman belonging to a distant tribe; but it was impossible to obtain legal evidence of the act.*I propose that when we first heard voices we were specialists at following social rules the way squirrels are at hiding nuts. They have a sophisticated strategy that takes into account the availability of other nuts, whether others are watching, and the time of the year. [According to one squirrel expert](https://phys.org/news/2018-04-uncovers-squirrels.html), "Animals are as smart as they need to be, including humans. They have evolved to solve a particular type of problem, and for squirrels that problem is storing food and finding it later. They are really good at that problem."**Squirrels can’t introspect on their strategy, and neither could we.** We use our modern inner voice to accomplish introspection. The first auditory hallucination could not have been inspected using this tool. They would have been interpreted by a social beast keen to please. Suddenly the voice of society (or perhaps specifically our parents, chief, rival, etc) make insightful demands from *inside our own head*. Gods are born, powers which we were unable to resist. There are echos of our dependence. Modern psychologists have noted that which we resist, persists. Imagine the meager defenses of those who first heard voices, whose subconscious barks audible orders, and who were raised to believe those voices are the gods. Ignore the dictates at your own peril! Every ancient civilization has stories about those who did.## The Bicameral mindThis is the argument made by Julius Jaynes in his [conscoiusness in teh breakdown of the bicameral mind]. 

Who was Jaynes?

“He was an old-fashioned amateur scholar of considerable depth and tremendous ambition, who followed where his curiosity led him,” says philosopher Daniel Dennett: https://nautil.us/consciousness-began-when-the-gods-stopped-speaking-3311/

Heavy drinker, son of a preacher man, heard voices, kind of employed as an untenured professor, spent time in jail by refusing the draft

“Can we work within the logic of an evil system for its destruction? Jesus did not think so … Nor do I.” He was sent to prison, where he had plenty of time to reflect on the problem of consciousness. “Jaynes was a man of principle, some might say impulsively or recklessly so,” a former student and a neighbor recalled. “He seemed to draw energy from jousting windmills.”

JJ calls this the Bicameral mind. We came at this picture from the start: what would the first voice looked like, given selection pressures. He arrived from a historical and philosophical perspective. Undergrad studying consciousness. Hears a voice “include the knower in the known”.  Spent decades studying ancient languages. Realized that there are no words for mind or thinking in early texts. Drew theory from there. 

> Or in the midst of some persisting problem. In my late twenties, living alone on Beacon Hill in Boston, I had for about a week been studying and autistically pondering some of the problems in this book, particularly the question of what knowledge is and how we can know anything at all. My convictions and misgivings had been circling about through the sometimes precious fogs of epistemologies, finding nowhere to land. One afternoon I lay down in intellectual despair on a couch. Suddenly, out of an absolute quiet, there came a firm, distinct loud voice from my upper right which said, “Include the knower in the known!” It lugged me to my feet absurdly exclaiming, “Hello?” looking for whoever was in the room. The voice had had an exact location. No one was there! Not even behind the wall where I sheepishly looked. I do not take this nebulous profundity as divinely inspired, but I do think that it is similar to what was heard by those who have in the past claimed such special selection.

Osiris, to go directly to the important part of this, was not a "dying god," not "life caught in the spell of death," or "a dead god," as modern interpreters have said. He was the hallucinated voice of a dead king whose admonitions could still carry weight. And since he could still be heard, there is no paradox in the fact that the body from which the voice once came should be mummified, with all the equipment of the tomb providing life's necessities: food, drink, slaves, women, the lot. There was no mysterious power that emanated from him; simply his remembered voice which appeared in hallucination to those who had known him and which could admonish or suggest even as it had before he stopped moving and breathing.

[Similar to what the aboriginal man described about his wife. He was still doing her bidding though she had passed. If the voice were king, he could tell his subjects to bring him slaves/women/food even after death. Hence Egyptian religion]

[some JJ quotes arguing his case. He’s so good!]

The chasm is awesome. The emotional lives of men and of other mammals are indeed marvelously similar. But to focus upon the similarity unduly is to forget that such a chasm exists at all. The intellectual life of man, his culture and history and religion and science, is different from anything else we know of in the universe. That is fact. It is as if all life evolved to a certain point, and then in ourselves turned at a right angle and simply exploded in a different direction.

*In the bicameral era, the bicameral mind was the social control, not fear or repression or even law. There were no private ambitions, no private grudges, no private frustrations, no private anything, since bicameral men had no internal ‘space’ in which to be private, and no analog to be private with.*note, this describes a state with inner voice _before_ we had the ability to deceive or ruminate.

“If our reasonings have been correct,” he writes, “it is perfectly possible that there could have existed a race of men who spoke, judged, reasoned, solved problems, indeed did most of the things that we do, but were not conscious at all.”

One of his students does a good job summing it up:https://www.julianjaynes.org/blog/julian-jaynes-theory/julian-jaynes-is-not-for-the-intellectually-fainthearted/?fbclid=IwAR2CRjdFqQRxFPjKGqqezHzoCZYAqxbWCnsMctJEigDKMi3lkbuBgNFf_XI

“The Linguistic Construction of Consciousness. Subjective introspectable self-awareness is a learned process based on metaphors. Consciousness, then, is shaped by historical-cultural forces and is not the outcome of evolutionary forces.”

## So everyone was schizophrenic?Not exactly. Schizophrenia diagnosed today constitutes a well-defined failure of the cultural prior to prosocially model inner voices (among other criteria). It also includes not having a sense of agency https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.570570/full#:~:text=Background%3A%20Schizophrenia%20is%20often%20characterized,are%20altered%20in%20schizophrenia%20patients.

“Another reason why voices can be so distressing is that they involve the disruption of a really central function of our psyche: the belief that we are in control of our own thoughts and actions.” I’m not sold on the existence of free will, but IDing as the control agent seems to be a fit delusion.

 In bicameral times humans modeled inner voices with a very different cultural understanding—speaking with gods, including deceased kings or family members.

Scott Alexander, a psychiatrist, makes a good case in his review of Jaynes: 

[quote about it being not that hard to induce multiple personality or IFS or prayer]

Certainly it would have been easier to function as a schizophrenic in a bicameral society. Though there must have been grades of relationships with the inner chorus of voices. The frequency and quality of advice would be highly selected for.

Jaynes accounted for a genetic component.

> My last comment brings up the possibility that natural selection may have played a role in the beginning of consciousness. But in putting up this question, I wish to be very clear that consciousness is chiefly a cultural introduction, learned on the basis of language and taught to others, rather than any biological necessity.

50 years later and we are unearthing genetic hints that ~100k years ago was a peak time for the bicameral mind he describes.

[will discuss the transition to consciousness more in the next post. Here we are concerned with the beginning.]

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Pictured: Man finds God## Consciousness emerges as a navigatorNeed to be able to represent multiple angles, say no to voices, lie. The ability to do this required self-reflection. The self was born. “you exist as a story inside your brain”

One can adopt a softer interpretation. That consciousness existed, but was decidedly different in bicameral days. Even then Inner voices started out as a simple mechanism of social control, and now constitute our conscious experience, we have to accept that a cognitive revolution occurred in the fairly recent past. 

Every time you hear early cave-painters described as like us, save culture [cite]; it’s wrong. They may have been bicameral!

**Evolutionary function of current inner speech**note that we can believe a soft version of JJ’s args and still accept that the _first_ inner voices were very very different than what we experience today, which is what I am arguing here. That it was a byproduct of TOM that results in a fit mechanism of reciprocal altruism. Once the voice got in our head, then there was genetic selection (for the ability to have a healthy relationship, for the ability to navigate). There was also considerable memetic evolution as our society became more advanced (including writing), and populations more diverse.

Royal society of science banned the discussion of the origin of language for 100 years because it’s crack cocaine for scientists. That said, my argument here may be a new take on the origin of inner speech. This is what I can find in the literature:

some debate about whether inner speech came first, to support more complex thought. Pinker says that speech is about communication, and that inner speech came second. It is a byproduct which happens to support complex thought. Unaffiliated researcher takes a similar approach arguing that it supported more complex behavior, specifically deception. 

“Understanding the neurodevelopment of inner speech could be significant for current discussions about the origin of language in human evolution. There are contentious debates on whether language evolved as mechanism for symbolic thought (using inner speech) ([Everaert et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full#ref27), [2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full#ref26)) or as means of communication ([Pinker and Jackendoff, 2005](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full#ref90); [Corballis, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full#ref14)). [Jackendoff (1996)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full#ref56) and others ([Rijntjes et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full#ref96)) have discussed the importance of inner speech in human evolution, suggesting that the development of inner speech supported more complex and abstract thought. However, [Pinker and Jackendoff (2005)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full#ref90) emphasize that, in their view, language evolved initially as means of communication, and that inner speech is a “by-product”: a later evolutionary development which is a result of internalizing external speech, which in turn supports more complex thinking. Here, we extend this hypothesis to suggest that this evolutionary development is related specifically to anatomical changes in the dorsal language stream.”“This is not to deny that inner speech enhances thought (Jackendoff, 1996), and that this enhancement has been a major influence on the growth of civilization. But given that inner speech depends on having outer speech, acquired in a communicative situation, we are inclined to think that if anything is a by-product (or “spandrel”) here, it is inner speech. The primary adaptation is communication, with enhanced thought as an additional benefit.” -pinker http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.494.2923&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Neither captures that there was direct selection pressure to have a social navigator. Not just a byproduct to make external speech better. (sometimes the conscience corrects our behavior and is silent to all.) Not just abstract thought in general. Very difficult to integrate symbolic reasoning into our cognition. I think selection pressure for a social navigator put it there. Perhaps including pressure to ID as the navigator.

There are other theories on the origins of inner speech.

jackenoff abstract thought: first inner speech was likely simple. Can’t have been selected for abstract thought

pinker byproduct of outer speech, aids communication: why is there so much evidence for bicameral mindset? If Bicameral is real we should reject inner speech being primarily about better communication

inner speech as deception: Once again, bicameral mind. Bicameral people not that great at deception. Not exactly a genius to hid people in a giant horse. From an evolutionary perspective, reciprocal altruism better strategy than lying. Of course mixed is best. But that must come _after_ inner speech emerges to internally enforce altruism.

[current inner voice acts as a social navigator, rather than a mechanism of societal control. This was the revolution which sprouted modern consciousness. More on that transition in the next post.]

## Mentalize (Language of Thought Hypothesis)Putting some notes here on a lose thread of this post. Mentalize is required for inner auditory hallucinations. Which means the brain was already using inner speach.

## Self-transforming elf machines[dalle: self transforming elf machines gallup on horses of language, synthwave]

[dalle: leprechauns dribble basketballs of light through space, Salvador Dali]

 After the ego has been suspended from the gallows of DMT, what remains of the mind? Psychonauts who plumb the depths of consciousness claim it is a land inhabited by pure language. Terence McKenna [describes](https://youtu.be/uJjR3aUhsOk?t=926) the leprechauns of his forefathers, immortalized in myth.*The classical myth about leprechauns is that they want to keep you. And then you have to bargain your way out. And the bargain is always the solution of a riddle. Notice that what’s happening here is that it’s all about linguistic prowess. It’s all about poetic skill. It’s all about language ability. Only the eloquent, only the clever, only those that are masters of riddlery and pun are acceptable to these entitites. Apparently that’s what they value. Why? I guess because they’re made of language.*He continues with his own experiences, having met them after taking ‘enough’ psychedelics (bolding my own).

When I try to describe to people what they are or what they look like, various things can be said. They’re like self-dribbling jeweled basketballs. In other words, they don’t have faces or anything. Not the little yellow jerkins or the pointed yellow shoes. …and they use the language to make objects. That’s how this language is different from ordinary English. **English can make meaning. The DMT language makes objects.** It’s like a higher-dimensional language. And so these things bound forward with the complete purpose of delighting you. And they reach into the air, into their bodies, into some nearby invisible dimension and they pull out, what I would call **words, puns, objects, hallucinations. Things which manage to be all those things simultaneously.** And they say ‘look at this'!’. And it’s purely designed to dazzle and astound. And then, a colleague, will elbow the little guy aside and say, “no! look at this!” and they’re all in front of you, chirping, clamouring, begin themselves to speak and float away and reproduce. …

*Like Henry Munn in a wonderful essay on Psilocybin mushrooms Called "The Mushrooms of Language" Describes them as self-performing acrobatic bits of grammar. This is clearly the same thing*

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Self-transforming grammar lessonsIf it’s too Jungian that an Irishman unboxes his mind to find a cadre of loquacious elves turning the wheels, see Munn’s full essay on the experience of Mazatec Indian Shamans. There may be something universal about psychedelics and language. McKenna continues “I don't know why there should be an invisible syntactical intelligence giving language lessons in hyperspace. That certainly, consistently, seems to be what is happening.” My interpretation is that consciousness is built using language, and when it melts away that’s all that is left. 

## The birth of consciousness

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

It’s not so controversial to say that our experience of reality is constructed. If there’s any belief you’ve updated, I hope it’s that much of what we consider special to human consciousness is the product of language. As Joscha Bach [says](https://twitter.com/plinz/status/1272957741523365893?lang=en), “We exist inside the story that the brain tells itself.” This should give us pause, considering how recently we acquired inner speech. As with so much, Darwin seem to peer into the future.*If it could be proved that certain high mental powers, such as the formation of general concepts, self-consciousness, etc., were absolutely peculiar to man, which seems extremely doubtful, it is not improbable that these qualities are merely the incidental results of other highly-advanced intellectual faculties; and these again mainly the result of the continued use of a perfect language.*The bicameral mind, was of a different kind. Our ancestors 100k years ago may not have been conscious in a way we would recognize. This cognitive revolution, both genetic and memetic, was results from our (im)perfect language.

## ConclusionHow did language get inside our head? This is the question that sparked my journey to the bicameral mind. I think that it first appeared as a simple mechanism for us to get along. We modeled societal demands, eventually hallucinating them as commands. We call our more subtle version a conscience, though it works in fits and starts, and often in conflict with the neighbor next door. 

“*[That we are so morally conflicted], Mr. Galton has remarked, is all the less surprising, as man has emerged from a state of barbarism within a comparatively recent period.” ~Descent of Man*Ants exhibit eusociality because of a genetic hack. A drone passes on more of its genetic material by the queen reproducing than it does having its own children. Though we are not eusocial, we owe our success to our striking social natures. This impulse could have started as Golden Voices. Memes living in our head telling us how to act. We eventually realized how to navigate these memes, inventing the human condition. Consciousness, deceit, yearning, sacrificing, creating. 

As JJ came to his theory from ancient writing, he dates the end of the bicameral culture to ~1,000 BCE. This is enormously difficult to believe (which is not to say he’s mistaken). It requires us to make huge updates about what it means to be human and the history of the world. As Dawkins said ['dawkins quote]. 

This post takes a modest stance on both dating (which I’ll discuss in the next post) and the magnitude of change wrought by linguistic thinking. Instead of relying on ancient text, the argument is about selection pressure, which we know a lot about. Language is a new invention running on old hardware. Its rise to dominance in our internal lives is a cognitive revolution which must have left cultural and genetic marks.

My dissertation distilled character evaluations from trillions of words in books, wikipedia, pubmed, youtube, reddit, and newspapers. Mostly, we care about the Golden Factor: does this person treat others the way they’d like to be treated. The rest is commentary (and comparatively minor personality factors like Dynamism and Order). We have empirical evidence for the modern direction of social pressure; I theorize it applies to our silent-minded forebears as well. Of course, this is an ongoing question. As Jaynes put it:

*What we need is a paleontology of consciousness, in which we can discern stratum by stratum how this metaphored world we call subjective consciousness was built up and under what particular social pressures.*I have the great fortune to be read by experts of psychology, history, religion and statistics. This post draws from many disciplines I only know superficially. Apologies for saying obvious things, or distorting evidence I don’t understand. I’m writing because it’s the clearest way to think, and I can’t help but think about these things. Please give feedback, as I want a clearer picture. Humans can meme consciousness from the ether. Likewise, we can unravel our mysterious genesis together. One final word on the role our shared consciousness of memes.

*No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were; any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.*

# unplaced textThere are many good reviews of Jayne’s work (by: [Kevin Simler](http://35.161.88.15/mr-jaynes-wild-ride/), [Matt McClendon](https://www.manicmatter.com/preconscious-hypostases-precursor-mind-of-man/), [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/), guy who says he doesn’t believe it, [Nautilis](https://nautil.us/consciousness-began-when-the-gods-stopped-speaking-3311/)), and a few hundred of the persuaded at [Julian Jaynes Society](https://www.julianjaynes.org/). [maybe put this in a footnote?][Trivers first called reciprocal altruism “time delayed reciprocal altruism”. It’s hard to reason that out. Maybe we learned it more like squirrels burying nuts, a patternmatched compulsion."]

Now we have incredible planning abilities. But when we first started trying to solve the problem of navigating complex society, the simplest thing to do was embody a compulsion to follow the golden rule. After there is internal language deception and resisting compulsion and thinking in symbols can all be used. But we should follow the principal of simplicity.

Your inner voice is likely still, small, and well understood. It is heard as you read along now, and at various times in the day. The first voices would appear in a cultural vacuum. Nobody to explain the imaginary voice privy to all your acts. 

As we were developing theory of mind in order to harness reciprocal altruism, I think the voices would have roughly along the lines of the golden rule. The mechanism would have started out simple

about 1% of the world has schizophrenia. This condition is characterized by a general disruption of self-processing and self-demarcation, including loss of the feelings of agency and auditory hallucinations ([cite](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.570570)).Your brain is hundreds of millions of years in the making. Consider how remarkable that we experience cognition primarily through language, invented at most 150k years ago[cite].

When I say inner voice, what I mean is inner voices. The way we represent the point of view of society as well as ourselves in our head using language. 

Immanuel Kant exclaims, "Duty! Wondrous thought, that workest neither by fond insinuation, flattery, nor by any threat, but merely by holding up thy naked law in the soul, and so extorting for thyself always reverence, if not always obedience; before whom all appetites are dumb, however secretly they rebel; whence thy original?"

I obviously believe in our ability to meme our way to truth. We can reach social Truths like the Golden Rule. We can reach scientific truths like the Golden Ratio. More impressively, we may have memed into existence a collective consciousness distributed across the minds of humanity. Science has a good method of iteration and memetic quality control: peer review. This post is too speculative and broad to be submitted to a journal. As such, I really appreciate feedback. What aspects do you find compelling? What parts are wrong? What testable hypothesis does this suggest? And if you don’t know, send it to a friend who would. Thanks!

I arrived at the hallucination hypothesis from two related questions. Why is my experience with cognition mostly through language, which is so young? What would the first inner voice have been like? I connected the latter to the Golden Factor, and then started researching inner dialogue and its edge cases (schizophrenia, unsigning deaf). This eventually led to Jaynes and the Bicameral Mind. Because I had some time to develop these ideas in ignorance of Jaynes, I chose to present them in the order that makes sense to me. Hopefully this perspective is helpful to the audience, even if they are aware of Jaynes. There are many good reviews of Jayne’s work (by: [Kevin Simler](http://35.161.88.15/mr-jaynes-wild-ride/), [Matt McClendon](https://www.manicmatter.com/preconscious-hypostases-precursor-mind-of-man/), [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/), guy who says he doesn’t believe it, [Nautilis](https://nautil.us/consciousness-began-when-the-gods-stopped-speaking-3311/)), and a few hundred of the persuaded at [Julian Jaynes Society](https://www.julianjaynes.org/).The duality of man is that we are also capable of profound evil. The next post will be a Darwinian theodicy about our transition away from a bicameral state. 

We can measure current social pressures via the PFP. I theorize they are similar to what was experienced 100k years ago. One test will be how similar the PFP is across cultures. Not a hard thing to do, given language models have been trained on hundreds of languages. (Speaking of which I’m looking to collaborate with personality psychologists fluent in non-indo-european languages. Reach out if that could be you!)

This post draws from so many fields it’s difficult to know what new ideas I present. Indeed most of it is a reframing of JJ. Tentatively, there are some contributions, such as connecting recent advances in population genetics of schizophrenia to the bicameral mind. If I failed to cite someone please let me know; it’s ignorance not malice.

I have the good fortune to have readers that are expert in psychology, business, statistics, and anthropology.

The primary argument is that consciousness may be downstream developing a conscience. There was enormous social pressure to live the Golden Rule, which requires modeling another perspective. Brain builds a network to house society’s demands, which issues verbal commands at moments of stress. 

This is a simple solution to reciprocal altruism, our most powerful selector. Other solutions require more sophisticated machinery. Modeling other perspectives + planning. Thinking of future back scratches while you scratch your friend. Initially, only the most salient feature (helping another) would have been hallucinated.

To me, occam’s razor suggests the first option. There is also linguistic evidence for vestiges of the bicameral mind. [JJ’s work]

This also explains why there is so much mental illness. Not only has our environment changed drastically in the last 10k years, our consciousness has as well. History started about the time we could ruminate, not much time to adjust. Particularly, this relates to the bicameral condition of schizophrenia, which is a human universal and carries enormous fitness costs. In summary:

speech

inner voices (Bicameral mind)

cultural framework mediates how those are experienced. genetic selection against schizophrenia

modern consciousness

This post discusses the transition from 1-2. PFP from language records strong social pressure to be a good teammate. This aligns with our theoretical view of humans being dependent on their tribe. One must go along to get along. I argue that this is a good explanation for how we got inner speech.  Other arguments have weaker selection pressure, and require more difficult mechanisms. Auditory hallucinations could correct behavior. Indeed, they seem to be selected for until about 100k years ago, at which time there was a shift and they became unfit.  Deceit and abstract reasoning could come _after_ speech has been internalized.

## How does an inner voice change consciousness?guilt→shame

fear→anxiety

mating→lovef

## The birth of godsWas it more fit to hear our own voice, or that of society? 

What would pro-social inner speech look like? Already had theory-of-mind. And we know people _can_ hallucinate what they imagine. See schizophrenia and even ‘healthy’ (how best to communicate this is not a value judgement?) people in times of stress.

Speech is a very new technology overlayed on an ancient compute mechanism. We should expect the integration to be rocky, and the impetus to be the direction with the most immediate payoffs. Auditory hallucinations of social demands satisfies both those conditions.

Does the inner voice now more reflect our desires or society’s demands? This depends on what you believe is the most striking difference between man and beast. Our personal politicking, or how willing we are to conform?

Some have attempted to explain this paradox by proposing that risk alleles for schizophrenia at some time in human history conferred evolutionary advantages (i.e., mating success or reproductivity) ([Karksson, 1970](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B9); [Waddell, 1998](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B27); [Turelli and Barton, 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B25); [Nettle and Clegg, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B16)), while others have attributed the existence of these risk alleles as a price paid for language and development of the social brain ([Crow, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B6), [2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00389/full#B7)). Not a new idea. Darwin and survival of the friendliest. How it made us more moral. That we must have figured out reciprocal altruism. 

I argue the most direct pressure on a social creature is not for more abstract thought or deception (though those are certainly important), but for conformity. Incrementally more abstract thought is not all that individually helpful. Yes it’s fit to make a better arrowhead. But this happened once every few generations, if that. Additionally, deception is quite risky when you live with the same people all your life. If one needs good will to survive, it’s easier to gain that by in fact being kind. The bar would have been quite low in those days. Be slightly less prone to act out in violence.

Current function of inner voice. [perhaps do this as a paragraph. Start with the Pinker debate. Then add the independent researcher. Then make the case for morality. We already had theory of mind to have language. We were representing society. We just started to give them a voice. In a simple society there is a lot of low hanging fruit in very simple conforming.]

Aide abstract reasoning

Make us better at language

Make us better at deceit

Make us more moral.

Not a new idea. JJ described it…

Describe our conscience  and the more cynical view of press secretary (Elephant in the brain). I prefer social navigator. The correct social navigation is usually to be good. But of course in side you there are two wolves. Though there are certainly fit occasions to cheat (especially for men).

I suggest that inner speech evolved as a social navigator. Competing theories in next section

## Jaynesexplain his ideas and my modifications

*In the bicameral era, the bicameral mind was the social control, not fear or repression or even law. There were no private ambitions, no private grudges, no private frustrations, no private anything, since bicameral men had no internal ‘space’ in which to be private, and no analog to be private with.*I think that self-id with inner voice must have come after the inner voice appeared. But was it society’s voice or our own? It could have been society. We already had theory of mind (cite wiki page quote saying theory of mind required for language). Maybe we sympathetically imagined others speaking, and it became an inner voice.

Was it more fit to hear our own voice, or that of society? 

Does the inner voice now more reflect our desires or society’s demands? This depends on what you believe is the most striking difference between man and beast. Our personal politicking, or how willing we are to conform?

Clearly, we have prodigious ability to conform. This is why memes are so effective. To the extent our inner voice is represents society, the collective has a compute allotment in your head. Note that in this view our deepest identity is _shared_ with all those we meme with.

*O’ what a world of unseen visions and heard silences, this unsubstantial country of the mind! What ineffable essences, these touchless rememberings and unknowable reveries! And the privacy of it all! A secret theater of speechless monologue and prevenient counsel, an invisible mansion of all moods, musings, and mysteries, an infinite resort of disappointments and discoveries. A whole kingdom where each of us reigns reclusively alone, greeting what we will, commanding what we can. A hidden hermitage where we may study out the troubled book of what we have done and yet what we may do. An introcosm that is more myself than anything I can find in a mirror. This consciousness that is my self of selves, that is everything and yet nothing at all—what is it? ...How do these ephemeral existences of our lonely experience fit into the ordering array of nature that somehow surrounds and engulfs this core of knowing?* Julius Jaynes, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral MindJaynes claims this is the state of consciousness once we ID with the inner voice. And I claim that inner voice is not just you. You are the average of the 5 people you spend time with. 50 or so if Dunbar is to be believed. (modest contagion of depression/anxiety in college roommates: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381550/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20in%20the%20medical%20literature%20conclude%20that%20mental%20health,contagious%2C%20much%20like%20infectious%20diseases.)

His story of calamity precipitating an human-wide existential crisis is just silly:

> The result is that, in the space of a single day, whole populations or what survive of them are suddenly refugees. Like files of dominoes, anarchy and chaos ripple and lurch across the frightened land as neighbor invades neighbor. And what can the gods say in these ruins? What can the gods say, with hunger and death more strict than they, with strange people staring at strange people, and strange language bellowed at uncomprehending ears? The bicameral man was ruled in the trivial circumstance of everyday life by unconscious habit, and in his encounters with anything new or out of the ordinary in his own behavior or others' by his voice-visions. Ripped out of context in the larger hierarchical group, where neither habit nor bicameral voice could assist and direct him, he must have been a pitiable creature indeed.

So, the same event that causes atlantis causes consciousness? Later, when describing how the changes must have happened, he says (available here: https://www.templeofthejediorder.org/media/kunena/attachments/22414/he361629.pdf)

> What we need is a paleontology of consciousness, in which we can discern stratum by stratum how this metaphored world we call subjective consciousness was built up and under what particular social pressures.

The PFP answers modern social pressures.

> We should remember that in the bicameral age men belonging to the same city-god were more or less of similar opinion and action. But in the forced violent intermingling of peoples from different nations, different gods, the observation that strangers, even though looking like oneself, spoke differently, had opposite opinions, and behaved differently might lead to the supposition of something inside of them that was different.

Basically that the bicameral mind couldn’t handle multiculturalism. He seems to believe in a garden-of-eden state where we lived in harmony. Our ape relatives and men’s broad shoulders make that hard to believe (source on lots of war: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685279?journalCode=jar)

> Deceit may also be a cause of consciousness. But we must begin any discussion of the topic by making a distinction between instrumental or short-term deceit and long-term deceit, which might better be expressed as treachery. Several examples of the former have been described in chimpanzees. Female chimpanzees will ‘present5 in sexual posture to a male to whisk away his banana when his prandial interest is thus distracted. In another instance, a chimpanzee would fill his mouth with water, coax a disliked keeper over to the cage bars, and spit the water in his face. In both such instances, the deceit involved is a case of instrumental learning, a behavior pattern that is followed immediately by some rewarding state of affairs. And it needs no further explanation.

funny banana story

> Deceit may also be a cause of consciousness…

Or, in the more usual situation of being commanded by invading strangers, perhaps in a strange language, the person who could obey superficially and have 'within him' another self with 'thoughts' contrary to his disloyal actions, who could loathe the man he smiled at, would be much more successful in perpetuating himself and his family in the new millennium.

To back up the unaffilitated researcher.

> My last comment brings up the possibility that natural selection may have played a role in the beginning of consciousness. But in putting up this question, I wish to be very clear that consciousness is chiefly a cultural introduction, learned on the basis of language and taught to others, rather than any biological necessity.

He rejects the chomskian view. 

## Pinkerhow the mind works

Julian Jaynes claimed that con- sciousness is a recent invention. The people of early civilizations, includ- ing the Greeks of Homer and the Hebrews of the Old Testament, were unconscious. Dennett is sympathetic to the claim; he believes that con- sciousness "is largely a product of cultural evolution that gets imparted to brains in early training" and that it is "a huge complex of memes," *meme *being Dawkins' term for a contagious feature of culture, such as a catchy jingle or the latest fashion craze.My view:

outer voice → inner voice (our own or that of society) → identifying with inner voice → modern consciousness

Symbolic reasoning and art are spandrels of the inner voice.

## Pinker> This enormous expressive power [of outer speech] clearly meshes with two of the other zoologically unusual features of Homo sapiens: a reliance on acquired know-how and a high degree of cooperation among non-kin (Pinker, 1997; Tooby & DeVore, 1987). http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.494.2923&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Inner speech related to both of those things. Cooperation for conscience. And for learning:

# Beyond personalityThe analysis so far has been limited to how PFP relates to general personality and language. Understanding this, we can move to more interesting questions. How is PFP related to intelligence, evolution, disorders, and consciousness?

## PFP and evolution*“Of the high importance of the intellectual faculties there can be no doubt, for man mainly owes to them his preeminent position in the world. We can see that, in the rudest state of society, the individuals who were the most sagacious, who invented and used the best weapons or traps, and who were best able to defend themselves, would rear the greatest number of offspring.”* Darwin, [Descent of Man](https://teoriaevolutiva.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/darwin-c-the-descent-of-man-and-selection-in-relation-to-sex.pdf).Humans edge, it seems, is not so much that we are smarter, but that we developed a collective consciousness.

We can track the development of spear heads over millennia, with incremental improvements over the centuries. Innovation was rare, what set us apart was preserving it. Were we smarter than Neanderthals? Hard to say. Our brains were smaller. But we did make more art. 

[we have pathetic little jaws and the technology of fire to even survive. We as a species are enormously dependent on one another.]

Going back to Darwin[cite darwin], there has been the idea that humans were under a selection for survival of the sociable [cite survival of friendliest]. In a tribe, there are many positive-sum interactions. Together we can take down a mammoth or stage a coup. This produces pressure to be nice to those on your team. 

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Connecting FFP to evolution is well trod ground. See Rushton in 200X

*“The position to be presented here grows directly out of Darwin’s (1871) view that natural selection endowed modern humans with larger brains, increased levels of general and social intelligence, and a more ethical and prosocial personality than “primeval man and his ape-like progenitors” (p. 159). Darwin wrote of increased levels of human qualities such as “courage, sympathy, and faithfulness,” and a “need for approval by others,” with a concomitant decrease in the frequency of “selfish and contentious people” who “will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected” (p. 159). Darwin described how moral and inter-personal skills go hand in hand with the greater intelligence modern people posses.”*Imagine the internal monologue of a cat vs a dog. Dogs were domesticated by humans earlier, and before that they lived in packs. Their desire to submit to pack hierarchy was refined to extreme levels in the last 20 thousand years of dependence on humans. This was indeed fit. Dogs now outnumber wolves 3,000 to 1. In cats, domestication is not so complete. They have not been with us as long, and lived solitary before. We could not co-opt the psychological space of alpha cat. As such, they can be our friends, but are much less interested in our approval. When was the last time you saw a guilty cat?

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

We have domesticated ourselves along the axis of FFP. The more our ancestors were generous, diplomatic, and kind the more the tribe approved. In general, this increased the number of surviving offspring. Clearly there are other strategies; Ghengis Khan had many children. But more often than not, social creatures must go along to get along.

## FFP and inner speechUbiquity of inner voice belies just how strange it is. Our brain is millions of years in the making, yet our primary experience of consciousness is linguistic. There must have been a cognitive revolution in the past 50 years. Clearly outer speech is fit. Here I argue that inner speech is fit as well, as a mechanism to domesticate ourselves. 50k years ago we evolved a conscience in order to navigate the social world. This must have been a traumatic time. Difficult to ID with this new voice in our head. This voice is the memetic substrate on which culture is distributed. With it came gods and art. Higher powers we drew upon to vanquish neanderthals, mammoths, and the endless horizon (we started populating the world). There is a human madness in polynesians populating islands using stone age tools. I don’t understand setting sail in the pacific with a little canoe, with only the stars and sea birds to guide me. But there is more of that urge in me than in an ape. Outter speach doesn’t explain the madness of the human condition. We must look inside. From outter speach we learn the PFP, the direction of self-domestication. From there we infer the fitness of conscience. Now we try to understand the implications.

Ender’s Game imagines a eusocial species humans with central cognition. Ostensibly, through they arrived to that cognitive state through the magic of [explain queen bee genetics, link to youtube vid]. Our Righteous Minds claims we are 90% ape, 10% bee. We have begun our path to higher consciousness using reciprocal altruism rather than sexual selection.

[darwin quote about selection for getting along.]

**The left an indelible mark on our consciousness. **Language gives society a voice in our head. Many of us view our stream of consciousness as ourselves, the seat of agency which makes decisions. The fact that this stream is in words should be a red flag that this isn’t where the action happens. Language has been around for ~50k years. Why would our brains—hundreds of millions of years in the making—use those symbols as computational substrate? The central idea in Elephant in the Brain is that the true decision makers are hidden from us. Our motives are selfish and deep. The top-level consciousness is more of a press secretary than executive. Decisions are made, then our conscious mind seeks to justify we are not violating norms, sometimes without knowing the true reasons. (Self deception means we don’t have to lie, which is hard.) We are so far gone down the social path that our experience of cognition primarily uses words; it’s not just how we interface with the outside world. Consider the Lexical Hypothesis in this light. **The FFP reflects the structure of self-justification that constitutes consciousness! [The still, small voice that reigns in our animalistic impulses.] **Note the etymological similarity to conscience which Oxford Languages (formerly, Dictionary) defines as “an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of one's behavior.” Evolution, angel on your shoulder.I contend inner speech allowed individual to better model society’s demands and their answer to them.  That is, individuals with inner speech have better ability to conform. When they chose their own goals, they have more ability to frame this in a positive light. (molify/ameliorate) This resulted in society’s voice inside our head. Hard to imagine humanity without this. Inventing language corresponded with inventing art and populating the world. Some suggest speech played a role. Could inner speech be part of the story?

Solves one of the main problems posed by Darwin, how we became moral. Coincides with a flowering of culture. Better explanation for inner voice than as an aide to working memory, which has been around for millions of years.

2020 paper by independent researcher on the evolution of inner speech: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00163/full

Excellent review of the situation. [Inner Speech: Development, Cognitive Functions, Phenomenology, and Neurobiology](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2015-22639-001.html). They search for the following keywords in the literature: *inner speech, private speech, self-talk, covert speech, silent speech, verbal thinking, verbal mediation, inner monologue, inner dialogue, inner voice, articulatory imagery, voice imagery, speech imagery,* and *auditory verbal imagery*. It’s quite distributed across fields. Also related to popular ideas of a conscience or a still small voice (religious).Inner speech related to working memory. It could be that, once we learned to speak and prepare for vocalization in our mind, other parts of the brain found these symbols to be useful. However, consider the social roots of language and the shared etymology of consciousness and conscience. It does seem that language gives society a voice in our head.

Possible genetic and epigenetic links between human inner speech, schizophrenia and altruism: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899312004362

“Altruism as a mis-exaptation of inner speech” section claims that inner speech leads to altruism and altruism is not fit. From Darwin to Trivers it’s understood that altruism can be fit.

“Recent data have compared the brain areas activated during sub-vocal speech articulation (inner speech) and during self-awareness tasks. The results show that the regions involved in these two activities are practically coincident. This can be taken as additional evidence for the existence of a link between inner speech and self-awareness (consciousness)…Inner speech may have evolved as an important new capability for the planning of behavior in humans. Accordingly, it is an exapted [maladaptive] function of high pre-adaptive potential that assumes fundamental importance for both social interaction and the maintenance of psychic homeostasis.”

Exapted here means [adapted for one function that causes fitness deficits in another].  The paper claims that consciousness uses inner speech. This is useful for planning behavior but results in two bad things a) altruism b) schizophrenia. In fact, inner speech (and consc

[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/JaynesOriginsConsciousnessBreakdownBicameralMindPSPPEdit1976.pdf) “Reminiscent memory (or episodic memory, as it is sometimes called), in sharp contrast to habit retention (or semantic memory), is new to the world with [verbal] consciousness. And because a physical space in the world can always be returned to, so we feel irrationally, somehow certain, impossibly certain, that we should be able to return again to some often unfinished relationship, some childhood scene or situation or regretted outburst of love or temper or to undo some tragic chance action back in the imagined inexistent space of the past. We thus have conscious lives and lifetimes and can peer through the murk of tomorrow toward our own dying.” Quite an artful picture of how consciousness unlocked the human condition. Not at all sure it went so. But also not at all sure I would be able to experience the pains and joys I consider life without language.He claims that we had bicameral minds, functionally schizophrenic, until 13k-2k years ago. Literary analysis of the Illiad. Far too late. Did Cortez find the Aztecs in a bicameral state? What aligned their transition with the old world? No, this transition likely happened soon after we invented language. I agree it would have been gradually, and included many schizophrenics. The inner voice is new, and used for so much processing. Also took some work to make sure we ID with it.

 We see art as particularly human. Herner Werzog makes a film about early cave art. Extraordinary to think that cave men had all the hardware for an existential crisis.

Inner speech is a ubiquitous phenomenon studied in many fields by many names. It is hard to say what about my claims are original. It does seem that it’s relation to altruism and GFP are.

Luvvie is the #ProfessionalTroublemaker @LuvvieThis piece has blown my mind since this morning: [luvvie.me/2Oe87c8](https://luvvie.me/2Oe87c8)

I'd love to hear more from people who don't have an internal monologue. Can you let us know what it feels like?

Many associated disorders, including schizophrenia.]

[paragraph on p vs GFP. Only correlated at 0.78, but BFI is very range restricted. I suggest moviing some questions about still small voice into GFP calculation. As those questions are also in p this would naturally raise the correlation. Not sure the right level, but we can be confident p and GFP are more congruent than 0.78.]

Given the relationship to inner monologue, one would expect to pick up deficits with questions like “Sometimes I think someone else is removing thoughts from my head”, as is done in g-PD (or p?).

[A Penny for Your Thoughts: Children’s Inner Speech and Its Neuro-Development](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full). The introduction is helpful, as is the section about the origin of language.

Note, in personality research social self-regulation is called self-monitoring, but it is instrumentalized as essentially an Extraversion test. FWIW it finds alpha and beta to be more related than the Big Five (surprise surpise). Asks the right question, how social self-monitoring is related to general personality. Unfortunately, hobbled by poor instruments on both sides.

 Self-monitoring and the Big Two: https://adl-manufaktur.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-Studie-Wilmot_self-monitoring_metatraits_JP.pdf

Society’s voice lives in our head. The Elephant in the Brain emphasizes our self-justification to society. Elsewhere, society’s good influence is emphasized. Self-monitoring (psychology), conscience (popular), still small voice (religion).

## PFP and intelligence“Future general factor research should include measures of intellectual disability to determine whether the *g *factor is also highly convergent with the *p *factor, *g*-PD, and GFP, a finding that would further question the unique interpretations of the general factors”I would extend the question to general population: measure g, not intellectual disability. 

[Claim: evolution happened on social intelligence more than g. The most common test that apes must pass is having their tribe like them enough to care for them when they are dependent. This happens in dramatic fashion for 100% of women with progeny. Much of g is written. Writing is a recent invention. Look at Portugues literacy rates in the 20th century. Four centuries after they had enough technology to conquer the world [map of portugues conquests]. 

Rushton gives some examples where GFP is just as externally valid. But in general g>personality as a predictor. 

Claim: g is more externally valid because it has a better instrument, not because g > personality.

[An ape would be as helpless navigating the Byzantine court than as an engineer at NASA. The engineering prowess that built Hagia Sophia, or the political games of the Byzantine court? What is the most notable feature of the Austrian empire. Maybe Franz Ferdinand and a web of tangled alliances.]

The two constructs, in fact, diverged over 100 years ago. [namesake of this blog]

One view of intelligence is that it is a subset of personality that we have better ability to measure (can be assessed with questions that are right or wrong, rather than self-report) and so has evolved into it’s own field. Intelligence research has gotten a long way with with PC1 on these tests. I don’t think PC1 of general personality will prove to be quite so singular. This is both because intelligence assessment biases signal which is straightforward right/wrong (and therefore loads on a monopolar(?) factor), and personality is broader so requires more factors to describe. To the first point, it clearly requires intelligence to tell an engaging story, but there is no single way to do it. I’m sure g correlates with however we would score ‘good story teller’, but it’s not directly captured by a test. Indeed, this ability may load more on the much less used second PC (verbal tilt) of traditional tests. Interestingly, general personality follows a similar pattern where PC1 is highly value-laden while PC2 (Extraversion) encompasses differing but effective strategies. I don’t think this is an accident. The most important distinguisher is good/bad. After that room for many strategies.

To the second point, this goes back a century and is actually why multiple factor analysis was invented. One general factor was enough to capture intelligence, but not personality writ large. This is why it’s misleading to call the first factor a general factor; we just should not expect to be able to represent personality so parsimoniously.

The Big Five place intellect as the fifth factor (openness/intellect). HEXACO excludes it all together. But note that intelligent and smart are some of the strongest loadings on the FFM. We may underestimate the concordance of g and FFP. NAME and NAME are interested in the same question:

Elephant in Brain and conscience give differing accounts of our inner dialogue. Elephant emphasizes us justifying selfish behavior. Conscience emphasizes society’s voice moderating our behavior. It’s a little of both. This helps answer the 

**The most common folk criticism of ****g**** is that it is book smarts and emotional/social smarts are more important. I don’t think this is just cope.** FFP characterized as [social effectiveness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916303774). Why would raw compute be more important for social animals? The two are correlated, and *g* will have more external validity than FFP by virtue of being easier to measure. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that *g* > FFP

## Julius Jaynes*O’ what a world of unseen visions and heard silences, this unsubstantial country of the mind! What ineffable essences, these touchless rememberings and unknowable reveries! And the privacy of it all! A secret theater of speechless monologue and prevenient counsel, an invisible mansion of all moods, musings, and mysteries, an infinite resort of disappointments and discoveries. A whole kingdom where each of us reigns reclusively alone, greeting what we will, commanding what we can. A hidden hermitage where we may study out the troubled book of what we have done and yet what we may do. An introcosm that is more myself than anything I can find in a mirror. This consciousness that is my self of selves, that is everything and yet nothing at all—what is it? ...How do these ephemeral existences of our lonely experience fit into the ordering array of nature that somehow surrounds and engulfs this core of knowing?* Julius Jaynes, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral MindAfterword in the second edition can be found: https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/JaynesOriginsConsciousnessBreakdownBicameralMindPSPPEdit1976.pdf

He summarizes the book as four arguments:

Consciousness is based on language.

The bicameral mind. The second main hypothesis is that preceding consciousness there was a different mentality based on verbal hallucinations.

The dating. 12-3k thousand years ago. Bicameral mind obvious in literature. Cultural calamity (possibly a meteor strike) sparked the notion of *I*.

The double brain. Bicamerality due to left and right brain.

It’s odd that he believes the change was cultural. 

“The change from bicamerality to consciousness does not require genetic modification. The acquisition of a narrative self with and analog “I” and a metaphor “me” can be accomplished by culture and learning. The notion of neural plasticity was gaining credibility when Jaynes was writing.” ~Rowe. (2012). Retrospective: Julian Jaynes and The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. The American Journal of Psychology, 125(4), 501. doi:10.5406/amerjpsyc.125.4.0501

Clearly there is a gradient of how receptive people are to inner voice, and identifying with inner voice. Jaynes himself documents the many failures, including schizophrenia. Schizophrenia largely genetic.

I would like to tell a modified story

Consciousness is based on *inner* languageInner language evolved as a social navigator (after spoken language)

Transition from pre-linguistic to linguistic consciousness is basically how Jayne artfully describes. Hallucinations. Writing over huge parts of the brain such as memory. One difference: to Jaynes the bicameral days included speaking and but with an inner voice that we didn’t identify with. The painful transition was identifying with the planning agent. The transition I describe is larger: birth of inner voice, then identification with it.

Fear → Anxiety

Shame → Guilt

Mating →Sex

And of course there are other affects, like anger becoming our hatred, or more positive ones like excitement with the magical touch of consciousness becoming joy, or affiliation consciousized into love

Two reasons to believe dating is much earlier than Jaynes suspected.

All populations have an inner voice and we were separated tens of thousands of years ago. I take a chomskian view and believe humans have special hardware to identify with and integrate inner speech.

Inner language increases symbolic reasoning. Process must have started by the time we see cave drawings.

Can finally answer what put the voice there, and better guess when that happened. Much of his work in philosophy, and neuroscience remains relevant.

## Selfish MemesDawkins on Jaynes: “It is one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius, nothing in between! Probably the former, but I'm hedging my bets.”

Speaking is not sufficient to produce memes; inner speech required. Provided the substrate to ruminate on symbols that we sometimes share with one another, mixed to our taste. Culture running as a distributed process on all our brains. In cave art we witness remnants of the memetic cambrian explosion. As linguistic thinking integrated more fully into our psyche, memes had more room to run wild and sometimes drive us mad.

Note that these shared delusions act EXACTLY how one would expect a selfish meme. First commandment is no other gods before me. Commands jews to genocide those with foreign gods.

## Memes made me do itNietzsche and the Polynesians staring into the void. Consummate human experiences, totally at the mercy of memes.

## Is it hard to ID with inner speech?excellent coverage in: What is that little voice inside my head? Inner speech phenomenology, its role in cognitive performance, and its relation to self-monitoring

Inner speech may be an action, so maybe no. Still, the integration of speech to our cognition must have been a rocky revolution, even if it wasn’t experienced as hallucination. My guess is that self-ID must have been faultier at first. No solution works off the shelf.

## How old is language?200-70k years old. Insane amounts of debate.

“The shortage of direct, [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence) has caused many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study; in 1866, the [Linguistic Society of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_Society_of_Paris) banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the Western world until late in the twentieth century.”Lots of heat, no light. Even less on inner speech. Ever article on inner speech takes it as a given, standard process. (more evidence that Jayne was wrong on the timing.)

Selection for inner speech: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00163/full

“If inner speech is private speech internalized, as Vygotsky suggested, this begs the question; what selection pressure would allow the propagation of a mutation that allowed private speech to become internalized? The selection pressure I will argue accomplished this evolutionary feat is the need to hide one’s private speech from others; in other words, to hide what one was planning, to hide how one prepared to solve a problem, to hide how one was regulating their own behavior and emotions, or to hide what one learned, etc. In a social situation an individual would need to hide their private speech from others if their use of private speech would get them in trouble, thus, the need to hide one’s private speech from another would be driven by selfish private speech. This use of selfish is from an evolutionary perspective, meaning the use of private speech to increase an individual’s own fitness at the expense of the fitness of the community.”

This is certainly part of it. Closer to Hanson’s view. But it significantly underestimates the importance of reciprocal altruism. Our internal voice also helped us better model societal demands. For many, their worst critic lives in their head. Its genesis has more to do with modulating personal behavior than pulling a fast one on society.

## SummaryClaims

Inner voice is a central feature of human consciousness

It initially evolved to help us navigate social demands

Transition was likely wild. What is this voice? How does it know my heart, and ask for so much? Many new psychological needs and problems.  [author] marshals lots of evidence that identifying with voices did change the architecture of our brains. Eventually almost everyone came to identify with the voice (schizophrenia something of a throwback). Absolutely a cognitive revolution.

It is likely involved in super-organism urges: meaning, art, tribe, god. Maybe inner voice widespread by the time we see humans leave Africa with art. Truthfully, hard to imagine someone with an inner voice _not_ create art.

As inner voice becomes more integrated to our cognition, society has more memetic substrate. Kind of a soft sapir-whoorf. Not claiming that the particular language you speak molds your thought. Certainly does in edge cases, but theory explains too much (try using it to argue that X group, with 4 words, are retarded). But experiencing consciousness using language vs senses and emotions? Miles apart. Seems that a shared symbolic system won. 

Not sure if any of those are unique, this is very well trod ground. However, within the field of personality, this is certainly new. Consider this shitty paper which tries to connect inner voice to general personality. 

Note, the exact quote is not in the speech. If it’s a bit too on-the-nose that an Irish man gets high and sees Leprechauns, consider Munn’s [description](http://www.psychedelic-library.org/munn.htm) of a Mazatec Indian shaman (bolded where McKenna draws from)The mushroom session of language creates language, creates the words for phenomena without name. The white lights that sometimes appear in the sky at night, nobody knows what to call them. The mind activated by the mushrooms, from out of the center of the mystery, from the profoundest semantic sources of the human, invents a word to designate them by. The ancient wise men, to describe the kaleidoscopic illuminations of their shamanistic nights, drew an analogy between the inside and the outside and formed a word that related the spectrum colors created by the sunshine in the spray of waterfalls and the mists of the morning to their conscious experiences of ecstatic enlightenment: these are the whirlwinds he speaks of, gyrating configurations of iridescent lights that appear to him as he speaks, turned round and round and round himself by the turbulent winds of the spirit. Clowns are frequent personae of his discourse, the impish mushrooms come to life, embodiments of merriment, tumbling figments of the spontaneous **performing incredible acrobatic feats**, funny imaginations of joyfulness. Personalities are more serious. Others. Society. The faces of the people he knows appear to him, then disappear to be succeeded by the apparition of more people. The plurality of incarnated consciousnesses becomes present to him. Multitude. His is an elemental world where cruel, predatory birds wheel in the sky; where the star of the morning shines in the firmament. Outside the dark room where he is speaking, the mountains stand all around in the night.
