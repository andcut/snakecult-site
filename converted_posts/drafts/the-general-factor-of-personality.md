“Further, I will test the prediction, originating from Darwin (1871) and later articulated by Figueredo et al. (2004) and Rushton et al. (2008), that there is evolutionary selection for GFP. If both predictions turn out to be true – if women have higher levels of GFP in general, and if there is current evolutionary selection for GFP – then we would inevitably be led to the conclusion that humans are becoming more female over time in their typical personality, in the sense that human personality in general – of both women and men – are becoming more female-typical.”

Cool citation list, in that he includes both Darwin and Rushton. However, weird not to include any of the self-domestication people (eg. Brian Hare and Vanessa Woods). Further, the time frame estimated by these people is not the last couple hundred years. Darwin would have been several thousand to ten thousand. self-domestication claims typically go back 40kya (and sometimes explicitly link themselves to feminization).

0.18 to 0.32 standard deviations sex diffs in the results.
