  1. Intro: read the first part of the essay + short summary

  2. The Religion with No Name

    1. Muraresku’s real interest is in the contents of the religion: the key to immortality. He is an attorney that pulled himself up by his bootstraps. Raised religious (he went to Catholic school), but compelled to put his curiosity for hire to make ends meet. But the call was too great, which is how an attorney ends up moonlighting as an Indiana Jones.

      1. I feel a kinship. Deep interest in philosophy and religion, but eventually put away childish things. And yet I find myself moonlighting as an anthropologist.

    2. 


## The Religion with No Name


  1. Adding Genesis to his timeline can strengthen his argument. 

  2. He would like to connect this to The religion.

  3. My interest in Immortality Key was The Religion with No Name. 

    1. I theorized about a snake cult of consciousness that went around uplifting people and teaching them self-awareness.

    2. This could explain Genesis, I thought. Where Eve was the first priestess that extended the rituals to men. But there also seemed to be a connection to the New Testament. 

    3. I think the snake cult can also explain the New Covenant, picture this:

      1. We only have a fragmented view of judaism or Hellenistic thought at this time. Imagine the mystery cults and Judaism were two branches of the Tree of Life. The greeks made some advances on what it all meant, and perhaps Jews did as well (The Golden rule is attributed to Hillel). When Jews began to Hellenize, some of them noticed all the similarities. They then make a new syncretic religion. “in the beginning was the word”. John is rewriting Genesis, saying this is what it was all about from the beginning.

      2. One of the surprising things is how farflung these religions are. The mythological explanation is that missionaries were sent forth on a chariot of…serpents.

  4. Serpents are a re-occurring theme in these mystery cults.

    1. Marcus Aurelius

    2. Demeter

    3. Isis

    4. Jesus is compared to the Serpent that Moses raised on a cross.

  5. My ambition would be to establish a line back to the Paleolithic

    1. At least goes back to Gobekli Tepe




He clearly would like to connect this to all religions, and is just tracing one path. Runs into the same problem as the Stoned Ape Theory. Not enough shared icons. Snakes solve this, and they mystery cults are lousy with them!

He also emphasizes the high status of women in these cults. I think it’s because women uplifted men, literally putting a soul in them (by teaching them about self-awareness). Eve Theory of Consciousness.

Muraresku is enormously well-read, and is obviously aware that the New Testament is in reference to the Old. As he is trying to show continuity with other mystery cults, he shortchanges the Jews. However the Jewish connection can help him create a line back to Gobekli Tepe. 

Snake Cult of Consciousness, Eve Theory of Consciousness. Us evolving to be human. “what holds humanity together”

[I assume that Muraresku wouldn’t disagree with much of my writing. He is obviously aware that the New Testament implies a relationship with the Old. I do think he underrates how much continuity there was.]
