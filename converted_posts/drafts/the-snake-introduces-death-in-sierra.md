> The first man and woman had no night, and Yataa told the three of them that they would never die, that when their bodies grew old he would give them new skins: the old skins would shed, they would put on new ones, and they would become young again. So Yataa put the new skins in a package and gave it to the dog to carry to them. The dog carried the package until he met other animals who were eating food. The dog, anxious to share in the feast, put the package down and went to eat the food. One of the animals asked him what was in the package, and he told the story of the new skins. The snake heard the story and, when the dog was not looking, he stole the package, carried it home, and shared its contents with other snakes. When the dog reached home, the man asked him for the skins, and the dog told him how the snake had stolen them. They told Yataa about it, and God said that he could not take the skins from the snakes; from then onward the snake would not be allowed to live in the town with other animals, but would be driven out to live by himself. So now, when man grows old, he must die because the snake stole the skins, man always tries to kill him.
