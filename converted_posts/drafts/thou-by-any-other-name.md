Depiction of the original sin by Jan Brueghel de Oude and Peter Paul Rubens[crop this painting to just be adam and eve]

All over the world it is said that man once lived in harmony with nature and god. Through some mistake (eg. a messenger arrives too late) or disobedience on the part of humans (often woman), the human condition is born. We now labor in a state of alienation and uncertainty; free—required—to choose. The more religiously minded such as Karl Jung, Jordan Peterson, and Joseph Campbell, teach that widespread stories contain key psychological Truths—that the old wisdom still applies. And in fact that all living are inexorably tied these myths; all our technology reduced to futile devices when wielded against the big questions. In this post I’ll go a step farther and argue that anthropogenic accounts contain a kernel of historicity; they are describing the bicameral breakdown. Synthesizing these stories, linguistic changes, bicameral theory, and modern psychological gender differences, this post argues that women became self-aware first and the male perspective of the bicameral breakdown is recorded in various religious texts. This cognitive change may have sparked the agricultural revolution.

As a note, this is the third post in a series that started by analyzing the lexical hypothesis. The first is not essential to understand this piece. But you should read the second, which describes what could have produced the bicameral mind. Today we discuss what Jaynes referred to as the origins of consciousness: the breakdown of the bicameral mind. In what situations would such a mind fail? For whom? And when?

# Thou by any other nameEarly in his book, Jaynes makes an etymological case for our recent bicameral breakdown.

*It is not always obvious that metaphor has played this all-important function. But this is because the concrete metaphiers become hidden in phonemic change, leaving the words to exist on their own. Even such an unmetaphorical-sounding word as the verb 'to be' was generated from a metaphor. It comes from the Sanskrit bhu, to grow, or make grow, while the English forms 'am' and 'is' have evolved from the same root as the Sanskrit asmi, to breathe. It is something of a lovely surprise that the irregular conjugation of our most nondescript verb is thus a record of a time when man had no independent word for 'existence' and could only say that something 'grows' or that it breathes. ~Julian Jaynes, *To me, this evidence represents a problem for his proposed date. If English and Sanskrit share metaphors for breathing and being[^1], it’s likely the two concepts were connected at the root of the language family. There is debate about how far back the Indo-European extends, but [most](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1219669) [papers](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1219669) say ~8k years, 4.5k years before Jaynes marks the bicameral breakdown.This suggest an interesting path forward. If we find the largest class of languages which share cognates related to consciousness, can we glean where it started? What words would emerge after the breakdown of the bicameral mind? ‘I’, for one. Possibly also words like “to be” and adverbs which require a concept of being in order to exist. We should also expect words related to spirit or soul, as that is the relationship that changed.

[Ultraconserved words point to deep language ancestry across Eurasia](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1218726110) suggests a language super-family based on a cluster of words with cognates among 7 language families. The root of this language group is said to be 15k years old and span Eurasia.

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

[Figure 1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1218726110#fig01) from Pagel et al.‘Thou’ is the only one cognate that spans all seven families. ‘I’ spans 6 and by another metric is the most preserved (see their Table 1). The entire list of words spanning at least 4 families: **Thou, I, Not, That, We, To give, Who, This, What, Man/male, Ye, Old, Mother, To hear, Hand, Fire, To pull, Black, To flow, Bark, Ashes, To spit, and Worm**. Notably, some common words, such as numbers, are not on this list. The authors [point out](https://ehl.santafe.edu/EhlforWeb.pdf) this isn’t the language of Adam and Eve. Language has existed for far more than 15,000 years. But there are portions of vocabulary that seem to be shared across much of the globe starting at a less ancient date. Notice that many words have to do with identity: thou, I, that, we, who, this, what, ye. This core group spanning language families is consistent with a recent consciousness event. Pronouns, a new invention, radiating from the locus of discovery. Bicameral man, it seems, could count and probably name all sorts of animals. But he could not talk about self for he had none. 

There is a lot of methodological uncertainty peering back 15k years at reconstructed words. One [response paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761561/) calls the whole project a method that sees ‘faces in fire’. Linguists generally accept that phonemes can be analyzed back about ~8,000 years, but debate where to draw the line. So we should approach the word list with humility. And indeed, for the purposes of this post we can accept a very weak version of the Euroasiatic super family. It would suffice that this statistical group is tied together by cognitive loan words. That the constituent families are separate, apart from identity words, which were borrowed widely when it was discovered.## Semantic change as cognitive adaptation processhttps://dea.lib.unideb.hu/dea/bitstream/handle/2437/79774/de_1450.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

[quote extensively from the first paragraph of section 3.6. Argue that if there was a bicameral breakdown, there has to be some sort of linguistic revolution as well. And in fact it would produce a list much like we find in the ultraconserved words. (produced by researchers with no knowledge of the bicameral mind!)]

This framing also answers another question posed by the linguistic work: what is the event that precipitated one language group to expand? The authors note the root date correlates with the retreat of the glaciers, a time of great population migration. But this is criticized: “It is no explanation of why Eurasiatic should exist at all. Why should changing climate have favored just one language lineage, out of a single homeland, to dominate Eurasia, rather than a generalized advance of multiple, independent groups right across the continent?” The breakdown of bicameral mind is an excellent candidate. A newly self aware people spreading their theory of mind across the continent. A saga that paleontologists of pronouns can reconstruct 15,000 years later.

# Sirius business[how long can memes survive?]

The central methodological issue is that words are relations between a concept and a sound, but sounds change. Well, how long are symbolic relationships preserved when the physical anchor doesn’t change? We can answer this by looking to the stars. The [Cosmic Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Hunt) is an ancient story with versions told from North America, to Eurasia, to Africa, to Australia. Common to the story is a hunt—of a bear or ungulate—that ends with the prey being cast up to the firmament. If you can find Ursa Major you know a remnant of this tradition. (I believe this was passed along as part of the ritual of consciousness, but that is for another post.)

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Johann Bayer, Ursa MajorThe myth is [estimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Hunt) to be at least 15,000 years old. This estimate is less prone to error because sharing the story requires crossing the Bering Land Bridge, the timing of which is studied by many fields. As this meme is tied to the same constellation of stars, and spans multiple continents, we can be confident that memes can be passed on for at least 15k years within Eurasia. In fact, this indicates that the ultraconserved words may be undercounted. There are likely direct memetic lineages we can’t detect because the phonetics—but not meaning—change too quickly. Our tongue is no north star. [The Evolution of Myths](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26047253) builds a phylogenetic tree modeling the mutations in the life cycle of the Cosmic Hunt. The author concludes:*My more immediate goal is to expand and refine the burgeoning phylogenetic supertree of Paleolithic myths, which already includes stories of the life-giving sun as a big mammal and of women as primordial guardians of sacred knowledge sanctuaries*Having some suggestive linguistic evidence that something important happened to our sense of self 15k years ago, we turn our attention to the primordial guardians of knowledge.

[this quote probably belongs after the reading of Genesis. Bring up this quote, then talk about his next paper. Suggest it fails because he places the root node in Africa, when it belongs in Eurasia at the locus of linguistic innovation.]

# Worldwide serpent story[worth bringing up another widespread theme because we will look at a couple instantiations of it today.]

British surgeon in India: https://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/vao/vao03.htm

“The serpent has been viewed with awe or veneration from primeval times, and almost universally as a re-embodiment of a deceased human being, and as such there were ascribed to it the attributes of life and wisdom, and the power of healing.” 1888

Describe Quetsequatl. 

Curius that snakes are so often associated with knowledge. They are very dumb animals!

# Djinn/jinn/genius[final linguistic note before moving on. I’m no linguist, but did stumble upon a coincidence that may have to do with the bicameral breakdown.]

We would expect consciousness words to be shared across language families as well. I’m not linguist, but I did manage to find a good candidate.  Asked about on Quora. But the credentialists not having it.

> It’s a little complicated. Both words originally derive from the Latin word genius, originally meaning the ‘male spirit of a family’, and later a ‘spirit’ (of a place or organization) or ‘demon’, ‘talent’, ‘person endowed with talent’ (OED).

By coincidence, the Arabic word jinn means a kind of supernatural being below the angels, and starting in the 18th century, the word genie (and also genius) became conflated with jinn.

From quora describing genie and genius: “They both come from the same ancient IndoEuropean root word *gen- which means “to give birth, beget.” Genius originally referred to a benevolent spirit that indwelled a person and guided them.”

This is literally the bicameral mind. Exactly what you would expect shared between language families in a bicameral breakdown. Arabic and chinese are not indo-european and yet have the same name.

Does ‘genus’ mean family because the genie was often family members?

Genius is connected to snake

“Title of Thesis: Roman Domestic Religion: A Study of the Roman Lararia” : https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/20495/1187729.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

The chapter on The Genius mentions ‘serpent’ or ‘snake’ 207 times in just 42 pages (as per my ctrl-f research). 

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Include actual quotes of servius and gellius

The Latin Grammarian Servius explains: “No place is without its genius that usually appears in the form of the snake” [The Untranslated](https://twitter.com/TheUntranslated) [adds](https://theuntranslated.wordpress.com/2015/09/28/reading-zettels-traum-week-10-pp-97-107/) “The etyms of ‘locus’ suggest not only ‘madness’, but also ‘drugs’, invoking thus the widespread tradition of seeing genius closely connected with insanity and mind-altering substance.”Snake is worldwide associated with spiritual wisdom. Consider the maya. I know, there are only so many animals, and so many sounds, and every 

Or the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica: “In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives; among the Amazulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes; the Masai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.”

Note that “worm” is on the list of ultraconserved words. Cragenford connects this to serpents in his video on the paper.

Djinn takes the form of a snake or dog. 

[conclude this section. From all this I’d like the reader to be open to the idea of a phylogenetic tree myths. That memes from 15k years ago are distributed across the globe, and did not emerge independently. These not obviously related to bicameralism, but just support the durability of important memes. Linguistically, another line of research has produced a set of words that emerged 15k years ago that do align with the bicameral theory.]

# Why leave Eden?The previous post quotes Darwin’s description of an aboriginal man haunted by the specter of his dead wife. She had died of disease, and wanted him to avenge her by killing a woman from a neighboring tribe. He became ill resisting her demands and eventually skipped town to do her bidding. He returned a year later in high spirits and, we gather, with blood on his hands. I don’t think this man was bicameral, persay. But it may be a continuum and he was certainly closer than you or I. 

Clearly, there is utility in navigating these voices. They sometimes demand unfit actions like building pyramids or human sacrifice. More commonly, society places competing demands. One tribeswoman wants you to watch after her child and another wants you to fetch water. Everyone wants more than their share of the rabbit you hunted. In modern life, navigating these sorts of demands is an important part of development. One in which our inner dialogue is crucial.

Finally, there is the question of defecting. Why not keep all the rabbit for oneself? Shirk all duties? Lie? If you can do it right, this is a very fit move!

The bicameral mind was a fragile moral system not capable of managing complex relationships. There are many reasons why it would break. 

# The Eve Theory of ConsciousnessBicameral Woman, perhaps with the aide of mind-altering substances like wine, first identifies with the internal social navigator flitting between perspectives. Not only can she take many points of view (including her own), she is the attentional agent managing their conflicts. She becomes like god, knowing good and evil. Above the gods, even, for she can reject them. She can introspect about why something might be good to do. Good for the tribe, good for her. Introspect about anything at all, in fact. This opens pandora’s box of self-knowledge; the birth of emotional derivatives like anxiety, love, and guilt. Newly able to ruminate on death and starving next winter, agriculture is invented. Women teach men the theory of self, perhaps with more wine and certainly with mind-bending rites of passage. Humans henceforth are separated from nature and from god—the human condition. This cognitive revolution scorched the earth, burning up any people unable to adapt.

Mother Goddess Eve, eyes openTo us, after millennia raising kids on memes sieved through millions of conscious minds, this mode of thinking is alien. I argue that such a transition happened recently enough for the male perspective to be preserved in mythology. It is the cosmic unity of Aditi. The creation through Gaia. Zues’s rebellion against the Titans. The labors of Herakles. Shamhat civilizing Enkidu. Pandora’s curiosity. And the Fall of Adam and Eve. This post is a Gnostic reading of Genesis. Faith is only required of those without the bicameral cypher.

*“What all myths have to deal with is transformations of consciousness of one kind or another. You have been thinking one way. You now have to think in a different way.” -Joseph Campbell*# The Fall of ManAnother problem with Jaynes’ date is that Genesis is a shockingly close fit to what the breakdown would look like. One of his acolytes covers this in [blah book]. But the problem is the story is much more ancient than 3,500 BP. In fact, it includes some of humanity’s oldest shared symbolism: that of a serpent associated with knowledge. [Aztec serpent god associates with knowledge, include picture. implies the original story existed before the close of the bering land bridge.]

## A worldwide taleExcellent article on The Fall on this online encyclopedia: https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/fall

In a Dogon myth from Mali, heaven and earth were originally very close to each other. But God separated them and made men mortal, after being disturbed by the noise of the women crushing millet. Similarly, in a myth from Cameroon and [Burkina Faso](https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/africa/burkina-faso-political-geography/burkina-faso) (Upper Volta), the vault of heaven was originally within humanity's reach, but when a woman who touched the vault with a load of wood she was carrying on her head asked God to move it out of her way, he moved it so far that he abandoned humankind to death.> Common to myths of the fall and to nostalgia for a lost golden age is the view that the original human condition was a condition of paradise. Heaven lay close to the earth, and people could go there merely by climbing a mountain, a tree, a ladder, or a vine (Eliade, 1960). Enjoying the friendship of both the gods and the animals—and speaking their language—man enjoyed a life that was immortal, free, spontaneous, and perfectly happy.

The fall may also result from human failings. Once again, the most important documentation is found in sub-Saharan Africa. A Maasai myth known in both Africa and Madagascar tells of a package that humans were given by God but forbidden to open; driven by curiosity, they opened it and let loose sickness and death. The divine prohibition takes other forms in other traditions. In a Pygmy story of central Africa, it is against looking at something; in a story of the Luba in the Democratic [Republic of the Congo](https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/africa/congo-brazzaville-political-geography/republic-congo), it forbids the eating of certain fruits; in a Lozi myth found in the Democratic [Republic of the Congo](https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/africa/congo-brazzaville-political-geography/republic-congo) and Malawi, it prohibits the taking of wild game. …The curiosity of the primordial couple who aspire to the secrets of the gods is a frequent mythical theme in Africa.> At pains to stress how humans had originally enjoyed the earth free from troubles, weariness, or illness, Hesiod now relates that Pandora had barely arrived on earth when she was devoured by curiosity to learn the contents of the vase she had brought with her and lifted its lid, thus sending throughout the world all the present and future afflictions and woes of humankind, leaving only hope at the bottom of the vase when she replaced the lid.

## A closer look at genesisGoing to try and put the breakdown in neuroscientific terms. With the bicameral mind relies on the ability to simulate different minds/perspectives. What does our mother want us to do? The chief? What do we desire? There is an attentional agent that can switch between which agent is active. I suggest that the breakdown involves identifying with this attentional agent that selects who does the talking. This puts us at the same level as the gods, being able to choose between good and evil. With that in mind, let’s consider the text, as closely as we can in English. We will use [Young’s Literal Translation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&version=YLT).**1 **And the serpent hath been subtile above every beast of the field which Jehovah God hath made, and he saith unto the woman, `Is it true that God hath said, Ye do not eat of every tree of the garden?'**2 **And the woman saith unto the serpent, `Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we do eat,**3 **and of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden God hath said, Ye do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest ye die.'**4 **And the serpent saith unto the woman, `Dying, ye do not die,**5 **for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it -- your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing good and evil.'**6 **And the woman seeth that the tree [is] good for food, and that it [is] pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to make [one] wise, and she taketh of its fruit and eateth, and giveth also to her husband with her, and he doth eat;**7 **and the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that they [are] naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make to themselves girdles.**8 **And they hear the sound of Jehovah God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hide themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the trees of the garden.**9 **And Jehovah God calleth unto the man, and saith to him, `Where [art] thou?'**10 **and he saith, `Thy sound I have heard in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.'**11 **And He saith, `Who hath declared to thee that thou [art] naked? of the tree of which I have commanded thee not to eat, hast thou eaten?'**12 **and the man saith, `The woman whom Thou didst place with me -- she hath given to me of the tree -- and I do eat.'**13 **And Jehovah God saith to the woman, `What [is] this thou hast done?' and the woman saith, `The serpent hath caused me to forget -- and I do eat.'**14 **And Jehovah God saith unto the serpent, `Because thou hast done this, cursed [art] thou above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field: on thy belly dost thou go, and dust thou dost eat, all days of thy life;**15 **and enmity I put between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he doth bruise thee -- the head, and thou dost bruise him -- the heel.'**16 **Unto the woman He said, `Multiplying I multiply thy sorrow and thy conception, in sorrow dost thou bear children, and toward thy husband [is] thy desire, and he doth rule over thee.'**17 **And to the man He said, `Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree concerning which I have charged thee, saying, Thou dost not eat of it, cursed [is] the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all days of thy life,**18 **and thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee, and thou hast eaten the herb of the field;**19 **by the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy return unto the ground, for out of it hast thou been taken, for dust thou [art], and unto dust thou turnest back.'**20 **And the man calleth his wife's name Eve: for she hath been mother of all living.**21 **And Jehovah God doth make to the man and to his wife coats of skin, and doth clothe them.**22 **And Jehovah God saith, `Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and lived to the age,' --**23 **Jehovah God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he hath been taken;**24 **yea, he casteth out the man, and causeth to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flame of the sword which is turning itself round to guard the way of the tree of life.In Hebrew *their eyes were opened* is more forceful. Something like:

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Adam, eyes openGenesis is, very obviously, the male perspective. Perhaps even the perspective of a quasi-bicameral man. Consider the conversation with God after eating the fruit. He had just had a mind-altering experience with his wife. She had shown him himself, and that he was an agent like the gods. The next day he hears the familiar bicameral voice, mad that something is up. As a novice to consciousness, he fumbles with deception, letting it slip he knows about being naked. He then immediately caves and blames his wife. This is a man in transition. Woman gave him consciousness *and that’s a bad thing. *Before he could live out his special interests—naming animals and following God’s commands—in peace.This is a story of how knowledge of good and evil brought humans to the level of god. For bicameral people, what better way to describe the realization that *they* were producing the demands. That they, like the gods, could evaluate what was right. This produced a deep alienation from the voices, brought awareness of death, and triggered the agricultural revolution.[don’t be quite so flippant. Be explicit that man lived at peace with himself in bicameral times. Things were simpler because he really could not ruminate. The transition to consciousness would have been painful. It’s difficult for us to decide things. Likely, there are some genetic adaptations/tendencies that make it easier for us than for bicameral men making the transition. Additionally, we were raised where this is the norm. My own belief is that humans are so mentally ill because consciousness is such a recent development. Many kinks are still being worked out. One gets a sense of longing to be one with the animals in the garden where choices do not have to be made.]

[Contrast the bicameral state with schizophrenia. Bicameral breakdown requires a new theory of mind. Some minds could not grok this new theory. That is schizophrenia. Schizophrenics have both an agentic inner space, and voices outside their control. It’s a kind of limbo that can only be defined when there exists a self.

# Dating the Bicameral Breakdown[If there was a bicameral breakdown, it is the singular story of what separates man from beast. Such a change would unleash a tsunami of memes. We should be able to track this event without squinting, it will hit us over the head if we have the right theoretic framework of how it happened. This is probably a good place to highlight my own ignorance. My background is in machine learning. I have a deep knowledge of things like regularization and validation loss, but am fairly ignorant of mythology and philosophy.]

Many people wonder why we made the transition. https://phys.org/news/2019-04-food-thought-farming.html

"A lot of evidence suggests [domestication](https://phys.org/tags/domestication/) and agriculture doesn't make much sense," says Elic Weitzel, a Ph.D. student in UConn's department of anthropology. "Hunter-gatherers are sometimes working fewer hours a day, their health is better, and their diets are more varied, so why would anyone switch over and start farming?"Genesis treats agriculture as a consequence of knowledge of good and evil. “By the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy return unto the ground.” I think that hunter-gatherer downtime works better when one does not have the ability to ruminate on one’s eventual death. This could have started the transition. Planting seeds to produce food in months to come, just in case.

Consciousness also helps solve novel problems (such as farming). Animals can be very skilled at what they are specifically evolved to do, such as squirrels burying nuts. But what sets humans apart is our ability to abstract problems and develop novel solutions. Jackendoff argued that this ability is what selected for inner voice in the first place.

**Given****a) the agricultural revolution is the largest lifestyle change our species has ever made****b) our minds define our species****our prior should be that a psychological revolution proceeded the agricultural revolution. **This helps with dating as farming leaves more archeological clues than theory of mind. We started farming [12k] years ago. So the breakdown likely happened sometime before then.## Tentative datePronounces started 15k years ago. It was also a big moment for memes in general (snake and great hunt). This is just a bit before agriculture at 12k years. So let’s tentatively say 15k.

This also explains why we invented agriculture so fast in the new world. Current debate says it is because we killed off everything. [insert chart from paper.] I say it’s because when we got there we were conscious. Old world people also discovered farming only a few millennia after the bicameral breakdown.

Emphasize that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This isn’t there. But it’s good to work with concrete numbers in order to refine ideas. Gotta put something out in order to get feedback.

## Gobekli TepeIn the window between proposed bicameral breakdown and agriculture we have gobekli tepe. Something strange going on. Lots of discussions of gods. Some claim aligned with dog star sirius [cite]. Absolutely covered in snakes [cite].

Sometimes discussed as the birth of the gods. (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/gobeki-tepe) In fact, the discovery of self was the beginning of the end for the gods. They could now be rejected. In the day we ate the truth it was they who would surely die.

# Mother of all livingThe bicameral interpretation of Eve’s moniker ‘mother of all living’ is as much about logos as labor. To the dualists out there, a case can be made that this was a real moment of creation. Eve invented the subjective. The I who can introspect “I think therefore I am.” The hard problem of consciousness. 

Perhaps this is why early creation gods all tend to be female.

*Joseph Campbell has pointed out that this change in human society can be seen in how (and who) humans worship: Campbell divides his study of creation myths into four stages: in the first, the world is created by a goddess alone; in the second, the goddess is allied with a consort and the efforts of the pair lead to creation. Next, a male creates the world using the body of a goddess in some way; and finally, a male god alone creates it. For an example of that evolution take a close look at the Greek myths (some of the best studied mythologies in the world) and you’ll see the evolution from Ge (Earth) to Zeus. At one time Hera was the primary goddess and Zeus becomes powerful only by marrying her. Take a look at Athene — at one point she is born from the head of Zeus. (For some reason it makes more sense to be born from the head of a man than from the vagina of a woman.) ~[Slap Happy Larry](https://www.slaphappylarry.com/three-types-of-myth-storytelling/)*[^2]# Guardians of Sacred Knowledge[Dig up a bit about guardians of sacred knowledge, give two examples]

## PandoraWriting in [late antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_antiquity) of the fourth and fifth century, the Latin commentator Marcus [Servius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurus_Servius_Honoratus) Honoratus explained that Prometheus was so named because he was a man of great foresight *(vir prudentissimus)*, possessing the abstract quality of *[providentia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providentia)*, the Latin equivalent of Greek *promētheia* (ἀπὸ τής πρόμηθείας)[Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero) says it is one of the three main components of *prudentia*, "the knowledge of things that are good or bad or neither,"[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providentia#cite_note-2) along with *memoria*, "memory," and *intellegentia*, "understanding.

Pandora featured in The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit, 1557, an etching ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro. Note how she forces her eyes. As in Eden, a snake is next to the knowledge.Note that once again having to eat bread—agriculture—is mentioned as a result.

# MesopatamiansEnkido taught by a prostitute. After he complains the animals are far from him, and that he grows weary when he runs. For early man, this may have been a striking example of the subjective. I have a weakness for existential crisis, but one trigger is running. “Why the hell am I doing this? It hurts!” Google returns many results for how to deal with inner voice while running. The great athletes are those who conquer this subjective. Michael Jordan imagining slights to pump himself up. There must be hundreds of cyclists as fit (and juiced) as Lance Armstrong. Watch videos of him. What makes him a generational talent is his supreme psychological fortitude.

This dance we have with the subjective, trying to tame our mind in order to exert our bodies, is recorded in our earliest story. 

# Giving science its dueOkay myths say women know first. But what does science say?

[could make a whole laundry list, but instead write a sentence (or less) about each of these. Make an argument that it’s just obvious that women care more about navigating the social and emotional world. to connect this to pschometrics the army wanted to test g, for obvious reasons, and included a battery for PFP. Only problem was it was essentially a survey of femininity, somewhat at odds with their policy on homosexuality. In more modern times, when a social intelligence questionairre was built, that women did better was seen as validation of the instrument. There was greater selection on women to navigate social world. As such, they would be first to see through the brittle bicameral social control mechanism. If you can’t see it, let’s ask a robot about who settles disputes with words vs fists. But I’m sure my readers are more socially savvy than AI (for now).]

# Women more domesticated/dependentThis is true now, what about in the distant past?

social skills always more essential for women. they produce way less calories among hunter gatherers, and can’t win a fist fight. Also completely dependent during pregnancy and first months.

They hear the voice of the god and act. Others understand they have volition and hear those voices, consider them, and choose. This is, of course a continuum. I claim that it was women who first grasped volition.

Argument is that the selection for/against schizophrenia was gendered. We should expect the inner voice to develop in a gendered way.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420456/

Several studies indicate that the incidence of schizophrenia is higher in men. Most of the studies found the age of onset to be earlier in men than in women. Findings on symptoms are less conclusive, with some authors suggesting that men suffer more negative symptoms while women have more affective symptoms.

## Non-schizophrenic women have more auditory hallucinations> The only extensive study was a poor one done in the last century in England.2 Only hallucinations of normal people when they were in good health were counted. Of 7717 men, 7.8 percent had experienced hallucinations at some time. Among 7599 women, the figure was 12 percent. ~JJ

And more hallucinations in general (compute as an odds ratio): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-022-00229-9/tables/2

conclude section with an update on the tentative date. women must have been first. No idea how much first though. As a teaser, I think Eve giving Adam the fruit is a G-rated version of an intense ritual of consciousness women designed for men. 

# Gender gap in consciousnessWomen would have significantly more power while they were conscience and men were bicameral. The ability to plan, deceive, and choose would have meant women could run social and cognitive circles around the men. How long did this last? More uncertainty the farther back we go. Will hold off speculating for now (I do have *some* limits)# Contrast with Jaynes’ dateThe bulk of evidence for Jaynes’s theory comes from the difference in language in the Illiad and Odyssee. If the (male) bicameral breakdown started 15k years ago, was he seeing faces in the fire? 

I don’t think so. The breakdown took a long time and may have happened in phases. First was the development of a private mindspace. Then the voices of the gods got slowly quieter as our theory of mind changed (more cultural weight on the *I*, the agent choosing between mental models), as well as genetic selection. One enormous cultural change would have been the introduction of writing. Illiad being the account of an oral culture, and Odyssee of a culture where some are literate. Also keep in mind that, although the Illiad is much closer to us than the breakdown in time, the progression was not linear. Memetic changes are a function of population size and ability to communicate. Both have proceeded exponentially. There is more opportunity for memetic change 3200 BP to now vs 15,000-3200 BP. So it’s not like Jaynes was catching the tail end of the breakdown. 

Using very little data, Jaynes produced an excellent description of a plausible and foreign mindspace.

# Summary of the seriesFirst PC is real.

how can it be response bias if it’s word vectors

if it is response bias why distribute it across the Big Five (the effect of varimax rotation)

Added a postulate to the lexical hypothesis: evolution along PFP is what made us human.

First step in that evolution was hallucinating the demands of society as voices. The bicameral mind. This helped us behave and capture reciprocal altruism.

Second step was the breakdown of bicameral mind. Eve gained self-knowledge of her relation to the voices. That she could evaluate and even reject them.

This transition is recorded in many ancient myths. Echos of the discovery also appear in statistical analysis of family groups, where pronouns seem to be discovered 15k years ago.

# Evidence, rankedThere is no reason we would ID with the first inner voice, whatever it was. This would imply a transition period of “hallucinations” and an eventual breakdown. Those that think we immediately ID’d with inner voice, why? Why is the ability still so spotty in modern humans?

Reciprocal altruism is more fit than better outer speech or abstract thinking, the two current candidates for the evolutionary pressure that started inner speech. The voices would have been about societal demands.

Many ancient myths describe the birth of self-knowledge in a way that aligns well with the breakdown of the bicameral mind.

This includes crediting women with the discovery, even if the rest of the story maligns the act. Greater dependence on complex relationships and language would have placed evolutionary pressure on women to develop better self knowledge. An advantage that women retain to this day by what we call social/emotional intelligence.

Statistical evidence that pronouns spread across Eurasia from one group of people ~15,000 years ago.

This aligns with other memes such as the great hunt, spreading from a similar time and place across the globe (more on those in future posts).

Paradox of schizophrenia. That it reduces fertility but is found worldwide implies we used to be more schizophrenic.

[I think people really discount myths as a source of truth because, individually, they are such a noisy signal. But we reconstruct noisy signals all the time. For example, your laptop successfully separates signal from noise on the very noisy 2.4ghz band. It can do this because it has a model and a key. We have the same when reconstructing worldwide myths. The model is a phylogentic tree. We can infer the content of the original story by comparing the many different versions. This produces a hierarchical clustering model with extant versions as nodes. This process only uses a vectorized version of the story (eg. many variables such as ‘contains ungulate’ for the great hunt). There is a powerful sanity check to this process because we can compare it to the geography of where these stories were recorded. To me this is a fairly robust system to establish that there was a root story. In fact, it is a more magical worldview to say that the many extant versions are caused by a powerful psychic unity of mankind. That it’s just so psychologically true that it emerges independently. (Of course, only psychologically true versions will survive; storytelling is competitive business.) But there are still many versions of the root which are consistent with the phylogenetic tree and extant versions of the model. That’s where the bicameral key comes in. If we suspect there was a bicameral breakdown, we can use that to suggest a possible root and check if it aligns with the data.

Not there yet with story of adam and eve. Eventually I hope to produce plausible bicameral explanations for both for the worldwide stories of the great hunt and trickster serpent. 

If we did become self-aware within oral history, then the evidence will be distributed across many fields. Long enough ago there may not be a smoking gun, but theory may be supported piecemeal. Small bits of evidence gathered from disparate disciplines is difficult for the current scientific apparatus to handle for largely bureaucratic reasons. If submitted to a journal, who would they find to review it? Even in the same micro-niche, hard to get such a panel to agree on what constitutes good evidence. In this case, where the claims are extraordinary, everything compounded.

MindVector promise that this blog will not devolve into “mainstream science can’t handle the truth!”. I firmly believe that peer review is important. Requires many perspectives to uncover truth. But remember that [peer review in 2022 is largely a product of competition between journals](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/real-peer-review/) that fails the standard in the sixth amendment: a speedy and public trial (of ideas). Papers can take years to publish. At which point the work and reviewer comments will then be unavailable to the public.I hope to capture much of the upside of peer review on this blog. Maybe just another one of my crazy ideas, but the public comments and polls are excellent and timely feedback features.

# Search for the Holy GrailComparative mythology tries to reconstruct a plausible root story, conditioned on the extant versions. This is aided by modeling the myths as a philogenetic tree so one can model the evolution of the story in a principled way. What I’m doing is actually easier. I have a theory unrelated to the myths, and use this to generate a root story. Then I ask, conditioned on the extant myths (or philogenetic tree of myths), is this a plausible story? In the parlance of machine learning, classifications vs generation. There’s a reason that imagenet came before dalle. Additionally, because the root story will leave all sorts of other clues (genetics, archeology, language, psychology), it can be conditioned on a whole host of other evidence. This makes my project much more feasible than the philiologists. Remember, Dawkins said the Bicameral Mind was a work of consummate genius or [utter trash]. This is the idea packaged with the fatal flaw of a 3,500 breakdown date. The actual psychology, philosophy, and evolutionary claims of the book are plausible. Moving the date back to 15,000 allows us to give the Bicameral Mind another look

If this is true it has extraordinary implications for who we are and how we got here. It means we have only begun on the path of consciousness. This could be why humans are so mentally ill. Many kinks are still being worked out. Movements that address the modern malaise often propose to go back to some previous state where humans lived in psychological harmony. But the bicameral breakdown implies that you could not go back if you tried[^3]. Not if a time machine dropped you among the [cave art culture]. Their lifestyle and rituals would not save *thou* from thyself. You know of the *I*, and your eventual death. We have crossed the Rubicon, though it be called Styx. There is no way out but to ride the tiger of consciousness. Of course the list above does not constitute extraordinary evidence. My goal has been to lay out a plausible story. The evidence one mind can muster with an idea and a few weeks of googling. If it’s true, there will be many converging lines of yet unidentified support. Laying out a concrete theory also has the benefit of being quickly rejected if false.

# PollsD is ultraconserved words contain pronouns

# Unplaced textI had no idea the PFP would snowball so far out of control. All I intended was to say that the first principal component was obviously not just response bias if it can also be derived from word vectors. The next post will wrap up the personality science angle. Then I have loads more to say about myths and the mind. They’ve been given short shrift for too long.

# The other paradox of schizophrenia[remove this. will just polarize ppl and get them to look for reasons to reject. play it smart]

AA have less mental illness in general. But 3x the schizophrenia. This is consistent with a bicameral breakdown happening out of Africa. The breakdown could have introduced many mental illnesses such as depression and autism, as it was an absolute cognitive revolution. It would also almost certainly produce selection pressure against schizophrenia.

lay the groundwork for saying that subjective experience did not exist before this moment. There was no “I”. No introspection. 

What would you be without an inner voice? With just hallucinated commands. Schizophrenics live in a tweener state. One of the hallmarks of the condition is a loss of agency. 

## Soft Bicameral reading of Psalms*I conclude that giving yourself multiple personalities is actually pretty easy under the right circumstances. Those circumstance are a poor theory of mind (I think borderlines are naturally bad at this) and a cultural context in which having a multiple personality is expected.**Jaynes says ancient people met both criteria. They had absolutely no theory of mind, less theory of mind than the tiniest child does today. And their cultural context was absolutely certain that gods existed. Just as we teach our children that the voice in their mind is them thinking to theirselves, so the ancients would teach their children that the voice in their head was a god giving them commands. And the voice would dutifully mold itself to fit the expected role.* Scott Alexander: https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/With that in mind, consider the psalms in a bicameral light. The son, who has been taught that modeling society’s voice in his head is god, is told:

[possibly cut first 4 verses, and those after 12]

My son, do not forget my teaching,    but keep my commands in your heart,**2 **for they will prolong your life many years    and bring you peace and prosperity.**3 **Let love and faithfulness never leave you;    bind them around your neck,    write them on the tablet of your heart.**4 **Then you will win favor and a good name    in the sight of God and man.**5 **Trust in the Lord with all your heart    and lean not on your own understanding;**6 **in all your ways submit to him,    and he will make your paths straight.**7 **Do not be wise in your own eyes;    fear the Lord and shun evil.**8 **This will bring health to your body    and nourishment to your bones.**11 **My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline,    and do not resent his rebuke,**12 **because the Lord disciplines those he loves,    as a father the son he delights in.**27 **Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,    when it is in your power to act.**28 **Do not say to your neighbor,    “Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”—    when you already have it with you.**29 **Do not plot harm against your neighbor,    who lives trustfully near you.**30 **Do not accuse anyone for no reason—    when they have done you no harm.**31 **Do not envy the violent    or choose any of their ways.**32 **For the Lord detests the perverse    but takes the upright into his confidence.Father giving his son a code by which to live long and be happy. Clearly agency is present (lean not unto your own understanding), but the voice of god is assumed to be closer. “do not despise the Lord’s discipline, and do not resent his rebuke.” Assumed that 

## Slate star codex*Jaynes argues the Bronze Age was obsessed with burials and the afterlife (eg the Pyramids) because if you had internalized the voice in your head as Pharaoh Cheops, the voice wasn’t going to go away just because the actual Pharaoh Cheops had died hundreds of miles away in the capital. So even after Pharaoh Cheops dies, as far as all his subjects can tell, he’s still around, commanding them from the afterlife. So they had better keep him really, really happy, just as they did during life. Jaynes presents various pieces of evidence that the main function of pyramids was as a place where you could go to commune with the dead Pharaoh’s spirit – ie ask it questions and it would answer them.*Who is better at gossip?

HBD: “The sole object of the work," we are told in the preface, "is to consider, firstly, whether man, like every other species, is descended from some preexisting form; secondly, the manner of his development; and, thirdly, the value of the differences between the so called races of men.""

Did Trivers cite Darwin? “In the first place, as the reasoning powers and foresight of the members became improved, each man would soon learn from experience that if he aided his fellow-men, he would commonly receive aid in return.”

## Romulus and remus theory of language.Are there humans without FOX9? Can they speak? Yes there are SNPs at FOX9. those with huge rare mutations can’t speak (among other problems), but the SNPs aren’t correlated with language ability.

Maybe it was like a switch, but if the transition were gradual, it would be women who first became human. Language more useful for women. Have to solve things with coalitions and soft power. Dependent during pregnancy. Still have a comparative advantage on language scores in every country.

wherever you draw line, my guess is women crossed it first.

“The sweetness of woman's voice may perhaps point to its early acquirement by woman as an attraction to the other sex.”

[^1]: I don’t speak Sanskrit, but it appears asmi means ‘to be’, not breathe as Jaynes claims. This could be why Jaynes did not think a shared root was the problem, he thought both languages took separate words—grow and breathe—to build a metaphor for being. It would be odd if such fundamental concepts as being were discovered independently in the same language family. Would the breakdown not be mental change enough to start it’s own family?It looks like ‘to breathe’ contributes to many languages version of ‘soul’ now: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₂enh₁-
