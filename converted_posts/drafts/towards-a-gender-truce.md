It hurts to think something you can’t say. 

My own story

  1. lost belief in mormonism while a missionary. ‘obedience is the first law of heaven’. Story of ‘touching unclean things’

    1. always good at intellectually taking another position. Would prepare for lessons by arguing both sides. Nonbeliever often won. As an example, celestial and terrestial bodies vs the three kingdoms. Latter obviously a nonsequitur with rest of chapter.

  2. Paralyzed, return to BYU. At least on paper, if I lose my faith I can be kicked out of the school, my job, and my apartment. Never seen that happen. But a friend did have to write an essay on the evils of homosexuality before they gave him his degree. Socially, many good people defending their god. I was fairly open and had someone tell me the school should kick me out to BYU Idaho. Mormon gulag. Thriving underground gay, feminist, and atheist scene. But sometimes, in a fit of guilt, one will flip and out everybody to the authorities.

  3. Family being crushed by mental illness and debt. White knuckling Mormonism to get by.




Could not discuss doubts with anyone. Psychological burden. Bicameral reasons. There is a collective conscious that we share in order to cooperate.

One result for this strategy is that Mormonism is more fragile and childish. The ruling ideology also becomes weaker when silencing honest debate. Inquisitions also hurt the believers.

There will always be a public and private divide. Not saying this should be abolished. But current largest disconnect is sex and gender. Can’t say anything about differences, other than that women are wonderful. See Damore or Larry Summers. Search larry on twitter. Many academics scoring points dunking. Remember, inquisitions hurt the believers too.

Collective conscious spends a lot of energy litigating this issue in mostly unhealthy ways. 10k scientific articles on STEM gender gap. Somewhat complex issue, but not that complex. Gendered difference in people vs things. Gendered difference in how valuable money is (more for men). Some sexism. That more gender equal countries have fewer engineers should be the death knell for much of the research that comes from the angle “how should we get more women into STEM”. Iran has an excellent method. Don’t let women go to public sporting events. Take away their rights, and show them the ticket out is getting a practical degree and moving to a better governed country. 

The gender gap is not that complicated. 10k papers implies how many hours? [do a rough estimate]. If the 10k papers (many of which written by women) had gone to science instead of this meta ‘problem’, we would be closer to parity. 

Differences not just a public policy concern. Navigating differences essential to a good life, (particularly if heterosexual). Navigating means representing. Hiding our internal models from others is painful. 

Smithsonian magazine on why so many monsters are female: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/meet-female-monsters-greek-mythology-medusa-sphinx-180977364/

> Ancient male authors inscribed their fear of—and desire for—women into tales about [monstrous females](https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-women-and-power-20171228-story.html): In his first-century A.D. epic _[Metamorphoses](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Metamorphoses-poem-by-Ovid)_ , for example, the Roman poet Ovid wrote about [Medusa](https://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph4.htm), a terrifying Gorgon whose serpentine tresses turned anyone who met her gaze into stone. Earlier, in Homer’s _[Odyssey](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/odysseys-end-the-search-for-ancient-ithaca-112739669/)_ , composed around the seventh or eighth century B.C., the Greek hero Odysseus must choose between fighting Scylla, a six-headed, twelve-legged barking creature, and Charybdis, a sea monster of doom. Both are described as unambiguously female.
> 
> These stories may sound fantastical today, but for ancient people, they reflected a “quasi-historical” reality, a lost past in which humans lived alongside heroes, gods and the supernatural, as curator Madeleine Glennon wrote for the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/medu/hd_medu.htm) in 2017. What’s more, the tales’ female monsters reveal more about the patriarchal constraints placed on womanhood than they do about women themselves. Medusa struck fear into ancient hearts because she was both [deceptively beautiful](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-depictions-medusa-way-society-views-powerful-women) and hideously ugly; Charybdis terrified Odysseus and his men because she represented a churning pit of bottomless hunger.

> Female monsters represent “the bedtime stories patriarchy tells itself,” reinforcing expectations about women’s bodies and behavior, argues journalist and critic [Jess Zimmerman](http://www.jesszimmerman.com/) in _[Women and Other Monsters: Building a New Mythology](http://www.beacon.org/Women-and-Other-Monsters-P1644.aspx)_.

This is all true. It was men writing down the stories that were probably meant for other men. The purpose of the stories is to convey truths, as they saw them, including fears. (What story is complete without fear?)

> She also argues that the qualities that marked these female creatures as “monstrous” to ancient eyes might have actually been their greatest strengths. What if, instead of fearing these ancient monsters, contemporary readers embraced them as heroes in their own right?

Clearly, there must be a reckoning about gender. Many voices espouse a strategy of “let’s become what they fear”. This leads neither getting what they want, and both hating each other. 

Men and women are complementary. There is tension, but also harmony. Discovering the complementaryness requires understanding each role. 

You can see this on the big screen where both left and right believe, correctly, that Hollywood does not espouse their values. Nominally, many films are culturally left. This lead the New Yorker to make deranged claims of white supremacy when a film like the Joker portrays a white man with some sympathy. But if you look at who Hollywood employs, they reify standard gender roles. Men, valued for competence, have a longer shelf life. Women still better to see than hear, as long as she’s young and pretty. These are very standard arguments from each side, and they’re both correct.

Personally, neither side getting what they desire results in untold misery. I want a world with less misery. I also want a world where people with my values don’t commit population suicide.

[my values are cooperation, productivity, liberal live and let live, respect, curiosity]

**Memetic vs genetic reproduction**. Your inclinations are due to your parents belief along with the broader cultural milieu. There is probably a genetic component as well. 

I grew up in a religious society where sex meant babies. The girl I dated in high school met someone when I left on my mission. Within a year they were married and had a child. Another girl I dated at BYU dumped me when she met a guy right off his mission. Within four months they were married. This was my Vietnam.

It’s strange to me when I see heathens on the right, who hold nothing sacred, holding up Mormonism as the ideal. They would have to be like 3 orders of magnitude more polite to make it in that community. And that’s part of the secret sauce! (FFP FTW) I’d personally like to place a moratorium on any man that watches porn from talking up the Mormons. Do you know why they get married so young? I knew a guy that wanted to castrate themselves just to make the pain go away. He now has 4 children.

Religious barriers are not that strong. Mormon fertility plummeting. Mass exodus of members (especially men). Ruled by gerontocracy[^1], unable to integrate information from the internet. Beliefs completely bodied by genetics and linguistics. The Mormons can’t save you.

Painful to enter liberal world through memetic conversion. I want there to be more liberals who are able to see multiple perspectives. Maybe it’s just impossible. But we do see variation between eg Korea and UK. Some room for culture. And the more immediate problem, misery, does seem to be tractable.

So now, how does a liberal society maintain fertility? Some moderation would be nice. See what the other side gets right. Some empathy, and some bravery about the nature of reality. Not super hopeful though. Through technology and culture we have managed to make all the private incentives align for mass immiseration.

Relitigate James Damore. What was up with those academics who made fun of him? Media plays in very bad faith, and an insane set of values are culturally ascendant.

Make the case that becoming a doctor is very bad advice. Long, miserable, and the off ramps aren’t great. It’s even worse advice for women who care about the mating market. The eventual money not as useful, and their youth more valuable. Are we ready as a society to tell that to women entering medical school? 

Personally, be kind, be curious. Take care of yourself, and touch grass.

[^1]: Nelson had this big buildup in 2019 about a big announcement. Pandemic hit. Was it about that? no. It was changing the Church’s logo and reversing the previous president’s acceptance of the moniker Mormon.
