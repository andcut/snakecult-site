[Dalle image of ‘angel voice in head’]

What does your conscience have to do with psychosis and evolution? Why does psychometrics find that success in humans, a social species, is more dependent on book smarts than people smarts? Should personality models explain who we are or how we got here? And what does this all have to do with language? This post seeks to answer those questions. For clarity (and fun) it’s written in a somewhat polemic style. Read to the end for a discussion of various claims’ epistemic status.

## Alpha and Beta[possible dalle illustration ‘intrepid psychometrician mapping linguistic landscape’]

Readers of the blog are familiar with the genesis of the Big Five. Calling upon the lexical hypothesis, intrepid psychometricians set out to map the linguistic landscape of character. [Using proto word vectors](https://vectors.substack.com/p/the-big-five-are-word-vectors) correlation matrices of common adjectives were reduced to a few dimensions. In the 1990s the field coalesced around the Big Five, a rotation of the first five principal components of such data. Proponents’ arguments then reflect current consensus about what the model can accomplish.*“The [Five Factor Model] does not provide, nor was it ever intended to provide, a model of personality dynamics or personality development. This does not mean that the Big Five dimensions cannot or will not be explicated at a dynamic and developmental level, only that the model was developed to account for the empirically observed relations among trait descriptions.”* John and Robins (1994) [Traits and Types, Dynamics and Development: No Doors Should Be Closed in the Study of Personality](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Robins-2/publication/232936932_Traits_and_Types_Dynamics_and_Development_No_Doors_Should_Be_Closed_in_the_Study_of_Personality/links/5d7031154585151ee49e4697/Traits-and-Types-Dynamics-and-Development-No-Doors-Should-Be-Closed-in-the-Study-of-Personality.pdf)Personality is one of the most theory-rich domains of life. People everywhere—not least of whom psychologists—have causal models for how traits relate and develop. It is an odd situation for the field’s general model to be explicitly mum on the topic. This theoretical vacuum was soon filled by Big Five metatraits explicated in Digman’s [Higher-order factors of the Big Five](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1997-42257-010). In this metanalysis he performed PCA on the 5x5 correlation matrix reported in Big Five factor studies. The first two factors were remarkably consistent across the 14 studies and aligned with theoretical models of development. Here he describes the first PC.*Another possibility, one that looks upon factors as causal agents, rather than simply a collection of correlated variables, is that Factor α represents the socialization process itself. From Freud (1930) to Kohut (1977), from Watson (1929) to Skinner (1971), personality theorists of various persuasions have been concerned with the development of impulse restraint and conscience, and the reduction of hostility, aggression, and neurotic defense. From this point of view, Factor α is what personality development is all about. Thus, if all proceeds according to society's blueprint, the child develops superego and learns to restrain or redirect id impulses and to discharge aggression in socially approved ways. Failure of socialization is indicated by neurosis, by deficient superego, or by excessive aggressiveness.* ~John M. Digman, [Higher-order factors of the Big Five](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1997-42257-010.html)Could such an explanatory trait sit atop the merely descriptive Big Five? Whether this factor is a statistical mirage and how it relates to the Big Five is an active debate 25 years later. This could have been settled from the start by analyzing lexical data, rather than factor-level scores.

The abstract of [Higher Order Factors of Personality: Do They Exist?](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868309338467) (2009)There are many papers that complicate Digman’s discovery[^1]. [Higher Order Factors of Personality: Do They Exist?](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868309338467) happens to suggest the correct course in the abstract: “Therefore, the hypotheses of higher order factors and blended variables can only be tested with data on lower level personality variables that define the personality factors.” ## α from the item-levelThe personality factors in question are defined by their word loadings on common adjectives[cite, cite, cite]. What happens when we do PCA on this structure? Imagine you have item-level survey data and perform PCA, extracting five factors. If you only report the varimax-rotated structure, how well can someone else recover the original structure? 

The good news, is we have the data to find out. Saucier and Goldberg published word loadings of 435 words on the Big Five. They have kindly made the item-level survey data as well. It consists of 900 psychology undergrads and law students who were asked to rate themselves on 435 common adjectives. I use this to calculate the word loadings on the original unrotated PCs. I also do PCA on the Big Five loadings they report, and correlate these. Following Digman, the latter are named with Greek letters. We expect to recover the original factors, plus distortion as some variance will be double-counted due to varimax rotation.

[title this figure using the data]

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

x-axis: unrotated principal components of S&G1996. y-axis: principal components of Big Five word loadings reported by S&G Calculated either way, the first PC correlates at 0.8. The later PCs are preserved as well. One can get a fairly good picture of the unrotated factors, even when rotated factors are published. We could remove ourselves further from the lexical PCs by designing an instrument to approximate the rotated factors (the BFI) and performing PCA on those factor correlations. This is the analysis Digman performed. So far removed from the source, he could not make strong claims about how the Big Two relate to the Big Five, language, or general personality. **However,** **they are by construction a distorted version of the first two unrotated factors in lexical data.** **Alpha and Beta are what the first two factors of the Big Five would be without varimax rotation.**Thousands of papers cite Digman, including many pushing back on his claims. To my knowledge, none make this simple argument to explain the Big Two. In fact, the foremost paper, memed above, analyzes data one step further removed from language than the BFI. Instead of using item- or word-level data, which the authors had in abundance, they rely on Big Five Aspects which are derivative of the derivative Factors[^2].

# What is α?By going back to language data, we can view α without the distortion introduced by varimax rotation or instrument design. There are of course problems with surveys. They are often collected on WEIRD undergrads who may or may not know the definition of all the words. NLP solves this by finding word relations in orders of magnitude more data from speakers in all walks of life. To those more familiar with surveys, rest assured, the two methods correlate [0.93 on the first PC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02092) of the same set of 435 adjectives. Here are the top 30 words loading on each pole of alpha:[list of the top 30 words at each side]

Digman put forth an accurate description, though in perhaps too Freudian for this century. This list reflects **social self-regulation.** How well can you regulate your own desires/beliefs/goals to make life pleasant for others. This list emphasizes politeness. Pinker notes that states now have a monopoly on violence, personally we do not throw punches. Historical data and men’s broad shoulders suggest this is a rare situation. My guess is that, anciently, norm violations had more to do with violence and sexual jealousy than being prejudiced or talking about politics[need better examples].This is different than social intelligence. Language is the view from society and the α represents society’s approval. Therefore these words suggest conformity and decorum more than raw social ability. Napoleon and Hitler certainly had social intelligence, though they are synonymous for breaches beyond the pale. 

That said, rules are made to be broken. Many people are well-liked, despite their norm violations. These individuals make the case for themselves using … **social intelligence**. This is a far catchier description that also highlights the parallels to *g*. To be honest, qualitative analysis is not my forte. But it seems that those who override their own desires do not become known for generosity and aplomb. Society places demands on individuals. An essential part of social self-regulation is integrating your own demands into the framework. Social/emotional intelligence captures this process. First, know thyself. Luckily, there is a vast literature describing this factor, no need to rely on me!

[dalle: pure social intelligence. Or, know thyself]

# Enter GFPIt turns out, that the first PC of almost any personality survey looks like α. Surveys of drug dependence, psychiatric disorders, or [what you think of werewolves](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585189908402160)—all return a suspiciously similar first PC. This has been come to be known as the *general* factor of personality (GFP). [the many names of gfp. alpha/gfp/stability. Not 1:1 but very similar: p, g_PD. These are all found via PCA. Can also get a very close match by using a social/emotional intelligence survey.]

Despite it’s near-universality, there is still debate about what it is. Consider the light hand even proponents take summarizing the situation.

*“Numerous studies and meta-analyses have now confirmed that personality traits tend to correlate such that a general factor of personality (GFP) emerges. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate about what these correlations, and therefore the GFP, represents. One interpretation is that the GFP reflects a substantive factor that indicates general social effectiveness or emotional intelligence. Another interpretation is that the GFP merely is an artifact based on measurement or response bias.”* Van der Linden et al, [Is there a Meaningful General Factor of Personality?](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/spanish-journal-of-psychology/article/is-there-a-meaningful-general-factor-of-personality/7B20E745B32E6D36ED67C3853A67FD18#)**The next sections answers whether the GFP is an artifact and in what sense it is general. The relation to the Big Five is established.**## Is GFP general?[primary is more descriptive. Both definitions are relevant. 1 of chief importance; principal 2 earliest in time or order.]

In what sense is GFP general? **g** is general because 1) every intelligence subtest is correlated 2) it can explain large portions of test data 3) it is highly externally reliable. GFP only meets the first requirement. The second goes back to the invention of multiple factor analysis, introduced in the namesake of this blog. More than one factor is required to represent how we talk about *character*. Personality word vectors aren’t a scalar.   Comparing eigenvalues, [Revelle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656613000640) shows that GFP doesn’t explain nearly as much of the data as *g*. This is fine and expected. Remember, intelligence is a subset of personality; we have words for smart people. So, like Revelle, I suggest calling this reoccurring factor the *first* factor of personality (FFP).Though not general, it is singularly important in the landscape of personality. personality concepts have to declare what team they play for (FFP+ or FFP-) before proceeding to describe some other concept. High energy…in a good or bad way? Even this neutral description of the second factor can be a devastating critique depending on the context. Just ask Low Energy Jeb! 

[show bimodal distribution.]

This may indeed suggest a hierarchical relationship to the other factors. This would explain why every item seems to load on this factor. Even if orthogonal factors exist (eg dynamism, order, beta) it’s difficult to measure them without also measuring FFP. We are social creatures and can’t help but process social desirability. Hence the persistent criticism that the FFP is *merely *response bias. Using word vectors addresses this by removing respondents from the equation.[Implication for psychometrics: Seems we may have to score non-GFP factors as their residuals, after removing the first PC. This makes for a more complicated scoring, but would allow us to much more sensibly discuss factors.]

## Political neurons (PFP is bimodal)As noted above, words are bimodally distributed on FFP. It’s almost as if there is a [neuron in the transformer](https://openai.com/blog/unsupervised-sentiment-neuron/) that sorts words into positive or negative camps, as that is of primary importance. I guess social evaluations must be good or bad so to avoid confusion we have few neutral words. Humans, too, may have a neuron sorting words first by valence.What happens when we factor positive and negative words separately? 

[plot]

The structure is remarkably stable. Even when the data is bifurcated along the axis that would most shrink it’s impact, it is the first PC. 

**Viewing this as language data, what is the rationale to discard the first principal component?** It’s social desirability bias? Yes, the axis is about social desirability, but why is that bias? Social approval is the most salient feature of character descriptions. Language is, after all, gossip++. Further, is this factor simply response bias? Response of whom? Word vectors?## Statistical artifact?Obvious by now that PFP is not just bias. We find it in word vectors as well as surveys. On surveys PFP is enormously externally valid. Usually more so than any Big Five factor. Rushton, “the genetics and evolution of GFP” lists X examples of FFP performing better than any of the Big Five. (ctrl-f “Construct validity for the GFP”). 

But to make it clear just what a powerhouse is, compared to other personality signal, look at the eigenvalues.

Below are the eigenvalues for the similarity matrix of 435 common words as measured by survey and NLP.

[new title: eigenvalues of 435 adjectives]

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Structure similar in either method; both suggest a few factor model.  In the survey data PFP explains 8 times more variance than the fifth factor, which is claimed to be a fundamental dimension of personality. Further, if one believes this factor doesn’t carry personality information, surely we shouldn’t spread that variance to the other factors via varimax rotation.

## Relation to the Big FiveAs shown above, the first factor is an order of magnitude greater than the fifth. When varimax rotation is applied, variance is distributed from FFP to the rest. Without this boost, the last 2-3 factors are tagalongs. With the added variance they are brought up to par becoming: Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness respectively. (Though Openness is not consistently recovered, and is often grouped with other traits like intelligence.)

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

This rotation is to the detriment of PC1—FFM—which becomes Agreeableness. Some anti-Dynamism is taken from PC2, and some anti-Order from PC3. From socialized, to a door mat. Gullible loads neutrally on PC1, but strongly on Agreeableness. Much of the original construct is lost, with just a 0.64 correlation. This mutilates the simple structure and has led to much confusion, including treating lexical data as merely descriptive. Saruman explains a similar process “Do you know how the Orcs first came to being? They were Elves once, taken by the dark powers, tortured and mutilated. A ruined and terrible form of life.” 

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Agreeableness emerges after years of statistical torture**We could have been studying PFP in a wholistic framework all this time. Instead we have Agreeableness and are still debating whether GFP is a statistical artifact.**# Beyond personalityThe analysis so far has been limited to how PFP relates to general personality and language. Understanding this, we can move to more interesting questions. How is PFP related to intelligence, evolution, disorders, and consciousness?

## PFP and evolution*“Of the high importance of the intellectual faculties there can be no doubt, for man mainly owes to them his preeminent position in the world. We can see that, in the rudest state of society, the individuals who were the most sagacious, who invented and used the best weapons or traps, and who were best able to defend themselves, would rear the greatest number of offspring.”* Darwin, [Descent of Man](https://teoriaevolutiva.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/darwin-c-the-descent-of-man-and-selection-in-relation-to-sex.pdf).Humans edge, it seems, is not so much that we are smarter, but that we developed a collective consciousness.

We can track the development of spear heads over millennia, with incremental improvements over the centuries. Innovation was rare, what set us apart was preserving it. Were we smarter than Neanderthals? Hard to say. Our brains were smaller. But we did make more art. 

[we have pathetic little jaws and the technology of fire to even survive. We as a species are enormously dependent on one another.]

Going back to Darwin[cite darwin], there has been the idea that humans were under a selection for survival of the sociable [cite survival of friendliest]. In a tribe, there are many positive-sum interactions. Together we can take down a mammoth or stage a coup. This produces pressure to be nice to those on your team. 

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

Connecting FFP to evolution is well trod ground. See Rushton in 200X

*“The position to be presented here grows directly out of Darwin’s (1871) view that natural selection endowed modern humans with larger brains, increased levels of general and social intelligence, and a more ethical and prosocial personality than “primeval man and his ape-like progenitors” (p. 159). Darwin wrote of increased levels of human qualities such as “courage, sympathy, and faithfulness,” and a “need for approval by others,” with a concomitant decrease in the frequency of “selfish and contentious people” who “will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected” (p. 159). Darwin described how moral and inter-personal skills go hand in hand with the greater intelligence modern people posses.”*Imagine the internal monologue of a cat vs a dog. Dogs were domesticated by humans earlier, and before that they lived in packs. Their desire to submit to pack hierarchy was refined to extreme levels in the last 20 thousand years of dependence on humans. This was indeed fit. Dogs now outnumber wolves 3,000 to 1. In cats, domestication is not so complete. They have not been with us as long, and lived solitary before. We could not co-opt the psychological space of alpha cat. As such, they can be our friends, but are much less interested in our approval. When was the last time you saw a guilty cat?

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

We have domesticated ourselves along the axis of FFP. The more our ancestors were generous, diplomatic, and kind the more the tribe approved. In general, this increased the number of surviving offspring. Clearly there are other strategies; Ghengis Khan had many children. But more often than not, social creatures must go along to get along.

## FFP and inner speechUbiquity of inner voice belies just how strange it is. Our brain is millions of years in the making, yet our primary experience of consciousness is linguistic. There must have been a cognitive revolution in the past 50 years. Clearly outer speech is fit. Here I argue that inner speech is fit as well, as a mechanism to domesticate ourselves. 50k years ago we evolved a conscience in order to navigate the social world. This must have been a traumatic time. Difficult to ID with this new voice in our head. This voice is the memetic substrate on which culture is distributed. With it came gods and art. Higher powers we drew upon to vanquish neanderthals, mammoths, and the endless horizon (we started populating the world). There is a human madness in polynesians populating islands using stone age tools. I don’t understand setting sail in the pacific with a little canoe, with only the stars and sea birds to guide me. But there is more of that urge in me than in an ape. Outter speach doesn’t explain the madness of the human condition. We must look inside. From outter speach we learn the PFP, the direction of self-domestication. From there we infer the fitness of conscience. Now we try to understand the implications.

Ender’s Game imagines a eusocial species humans with central cognition. Ostensibly, through they arrived to that cognitive state through the magic of [explain queen bee genetics, link to youtube vid]. Our Righteous Minds claims we are 90% ape, 10% bee. We have begun our path to higher consciousness using reciprocal altruism rather than sexual selection.

[darwin quote about selection for getting along.]

**The left an indelible mark on our consciousness. **Language gives society a voice in our head. Many of us view our stream of consciousness as ourselves, the seat of agency which makes decisions. The fact that this stream is in words should be a red flag that this isn’t where the action happens. Language has been around for ~50k years. Why would our brains—hundreds of millions of years in the making—use those symbols as computational substrate? The central idea in Elephant in the Brain is that the true decision makers are hidden from us. Our motives are selfish and deep. The top-level consciousness is more of a press secretary than executive. Decisions are made, then our conscious mind seeks to justify we are not violating norms, sometimes without knowing the true reasons. (Self deception means we don’t have to lie, which is hard.) We are so far gone down the social path that our experience of cognition primarily uses words[^3]; it’s not just how we interface with the outside world. Consider the Lexical Hypothesis in this light. **The FFP reflects the structure of self-justification that constitutes consciousness! [The still, small voice that reigns in our animalistic impulses.] **Note the etymological similarity to conscience which Oxford Languages (formerly, Dictionary) defines as “an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of one's behavior.” Evolution, angel on your shoulder.I contend inner speech allowed individual to better model society’s demands and their answer to them.  That is, individuals with inner speech have better ability to conform. When they chose their own goals, they have more ability to frame this in a positive light. (molify/ameliorate) This resulted in society’s voice inside our head. Hard to imagine humanity without this. Inventing language corresponded with inventing art and populating the world. Some suggest speech played a role. Could inner speech be part of the story?

Solves one of the main problems posed by Darwin, how we became moral. Coincides with a flowering of culture. Better explanation for inner voice than as an aide to working memory, which has been around for millions of years.

Excellent review of the situation. [Inner Speech: Development, Cognitive Functions, Phenomenology, and Neurobiology](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2015-22639-001.html). They search for the following keywords in the literature: *inner speech, private speech, self-talk, covert speech, silent speech, verbal thinking, verbal mediation, inner monologue, inner dialogue, inner voice, articulatory imagery, voice imagery, speech imagery,* and *auditory verbal imagery*. It’s quite distributed across fields. Also related to popular ideas of a conscience or a still small voice (religious).Inner speech related to working memory. It could be that, once we learned to speak and prepare for vocalization in our mind, other parts of the brain found these symbols to be useful. However, consider the social roots of language and the shared etymology of consciousness and conscience. It does seem that language gives society a voice in our head.

Possible genetic and epigenetic links between human inner speech, schizophrenia and altruism: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899312004362

“Altruism as a mis-exaptation of inner speech” section claims that inner speech leads to altruism and altruism is not fit. From Darwin to Trivers it’s understood that altruism can be fit.

“Recent data have compared the brain areas activated during sub-vocal speech articulation (inner speech) and during self-awareness tasks. The results show that the regions involved in these two activities are practically coincident. This can be taken as additional evidence for the existence of a link between inner speech and self-awareness (consciousness)…Inner speech may have evolved as an important new capability for the planning of behavior in humans. Accordingly, it is an exapted [maladaptive] function of high pre-adaptive potential that assumes fundamental importance for both social interaction and the maintenance of psychic homeostasis.”

Exapted here means [adapted for one function that causes fitness deficits in another].  The paper claims that consciousness uses inner speech. This is useful for planning behavior but results in two bad things a) altruism b) schizophrenia. In fact, inner speech (and consc

[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/JaynesOriginsConsciousnessBreakdownBicameralMindPSPPEdit1976.pdf) “Reminiscent memory (or episodic memory, as it is sometimes called), in sharp contrast to habit retention (or semantic memory), is new to the world with [verbal] consciousness. And because a physical space in the world can always be returned to, so we feel irrationally, somehow certain, impossibly certain, that we should be able to return again to some often unfinished relationship, some childhood scene or situation or regretted outburst of love or temper or to undo some tragic chance action back in the imagined inexistent space of the past. We thus have conscious lives and lifetimes and can peer through the murk of tomorrow toward our own dying.” Quite an artful picture of how consciousness unlocked the human condition. Not at all sure it went so. But also not at all sure I would be able to experience the pains and joys I consider life without language.He claims that we had bicameral minds, functionally schizophrenic, until 13k-2k years ago. Literary analysis of the Illiad. Far too late. Did Cortez find the Aztecs in a bicameral state? What aligned their transition with the old world? No, this transition likely happened soon after we invented language. I agree it would have been gradually, and included many schizophrenics. The inner voice is new, and used for so much processing. Also took some work to make sure we ID with it.

 We see art as particularly human. Herner Werzog makes a film about early cave art. Extraordinary to think that cave men had all the hardware for an existential crisis.

Inner speech is a ubiquitous phenomenon studied in many fields by many names. It is hard to say what about my claims are original. It does seem that it’s relation to altruism and GFP are.

## FFP and disorders[Given how new language is, not too surprising that evolution is still working out the kinks of planting society’s voice in all our heads. Many associated disorders, including schizophrenia.]

[paragraph on p vs GFP. Only correlated at 0.78, but BFI is very range restricted. I suggest moviing some questions about still small voice into GFP calculation. As those questions are also in p this would naturally raise the correlation. Not sure the right level, but we can be confident p and GFP are more congruent than 0.78.]

Given the relationship to inner monologue, one would expect to pick up deficits with questions like “Sometimes I think someone else is removing thoughts from my head”, as is done in g-PD (or p?).

[A Penny for Your Thoughts: Children’s Inner Speech and Its Neuro-Development](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01708/full). The introduction is helpful, as is the section about the origin of language. [The Emergence of Inner Speech and Its Measurement in Atypically Developing Children](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00279/full). Connection to disordershttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4538954/

Note, in personality research social self-regulation is called self-monitoring, but it is instrumentalized as essentially an Extraversion test. FWIW it finds alpha and beta to be more related than the Big Five (surprise surpise). Asks the right question, how social self-monitoring is related to general personality. Unfortunately, hobbled by poor instruments on both sides.

 Self-monitoring and the Big Two: https://adl-manufaktur.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-Studie-Wilmot_self-monitoring_metatraits_JP.pdf

Society’s voice lives in our head. The Elephant in the Brain emphasizes our self-justification to society. Elsewhere, society’s good influence is emphasized. Self-monitoring (psychology), conscience (popular), still small voice (religion).

## PFP and intelligence“Future general factor research should include measures of intellectual disability to determine whether the *g *factor is also highly convergent with the *p *factor, *g*-PD, and GFP, a finding that would further question the unique interpretations of the general factors”I would extend the question to general population: measure g, not intellectual disability. 

[Claim: evolution happened on social intelligence more than g. The most common test that apes must pass is having their tribe like them enough to care for them when they are dependent. This happens in dramatic fashion for 100% of women with progeny. Much of g is written. Writing is a recent invention. Look at Portugues literacy rates in the 20th century. Four centuries after they had enough technology to conquer the world [map of portugues conquests]. 

Rushton gives some examples where GFP is just as externally valid. But in general g>personality as a predictor. 

Claim: g is more externally valid because it has a better instrument, not because g > personality.

[An ape would be as helpless navigating the Byzantine court than as an engineer at NASA. The engineering prowess that built Hagia Sophia, or the political games of the Byzantine court? What is the most notable feature of the Austrian empire. Maybe Franz Ferdinand and a web of tangled alliances.]

The two constructs, in fact, diverged over 100 years ago. [namesake of this blog]

One view of intelligence is that it is a subset of personality that we have better ability to measure (can be assessed with questions that are right or wrong, rather than self-report) and so has evolved into it’s own field. Intelligence research has gotten a long way with with PC1 on these tests. I don’t think PC1 of general personality will prove to be quite so singular. This is both because intelligence assessment biases signal which is straightforward right/wrong (and therefore loads on a monopolar(?) factor), and personality is broader so requires more factors to describe. To the first point, it clearly requires intelligence to tell an engaging story, but there is no single way to do it. I’m sure g correlates with however we would score ‘good story teller’, but it’s not directly captured by a test. Indeed, this ability may load more on the much less used second PC (verbal tilt) of traditional tests. Interestingly, general personality follows a similar pattern where PC1 is highly value-laden while PC2 (Extraversion) encompasses differing but effective strategies. I don’t think this is an accident. The most important distinguisher is good/bad. After that room for many strategies.

To the second point, this goes back a century and is actually why multiple factor analysis was invented. One general factor was enough to capture intelligence, but not personality writ large. This is why it’s misleading to call the first factor a general factor; we just should not expect to be able to represent personality so parsimoniously.

The Big Five place intellect as the fifth factor (openness/intellect). HEXACO excludes it all together. But note that intelligent and smart are some of the strongest loadings on the FFM. We may underestimate the concordance of g and FFP. NAME and NAME are interested in the same question:

Elephant in Brain and conscience give differing accounts of our inner dialogue. Elephant emphasizes us justifying selfish behavior. Conscience emphasizes society’s voice moderating our behavior. It’s a little of both. This helps answer the 

**The most common folk criticism of ****g**** is that it is book smarts and emotional/social smarts are more important. I don’t think this is just cope.** FFP characterized as [social effectiveness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916303774). Why would raw compute be more important for social animals? The two are correlated, and *g* will have more external validity than FFP by virtue of being easier to measure. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that *g* > FFP.# Nature at it’s joints*“Lexical analyses and dimensionality-reduction methods are tools to explore rough contours of the personality space. We should not, however, delude ourselves into thinking that we are slicing nature at its joints to discover a “true” structure of personality.” ~Wiernik, et al*Many wonderful points are made in the response [Two, five, six, eight (thousand): Time to end the dimension reduction debate!](https://psyarxiv.com/d7jye/), but I am more optimistic that we can find simple, universal, and meaningful structure in Lexical data. It will at least be “true” in the sense the Lexical Hypothesis claims: the aspects of character that the speakers find useful. Psychometrics is a world without anchors. Is there a better standard than utility in everyday life for billions of people? [I believe language is essential to what make us human, and is part of our evolution. Our voice, intertwined with society’s, lives in our head. As such, I believe that lexical analysis can reveal true contours of our psyche. If that holds up, we should move on from general models of personality that only aim to be descriptive.]

This post seeks to unify p, g-PD, alpha, stability and GFP under a lexical framework. I argue the shared signal overcomes very different modes of data collection: natural language vs surveys, participants in psychology departments vs psych wards, Big Five Inventory vs surveys of drug abuse, PCA vs Bifactor models. Further, the lexical connections offers a host of rich theoretical interpretations from evolution to consciousness: what it means to be human. This is what it looks like to cut nature at its joints. 

In the parlance of tech twitter, there is still alpha in Alpha. Psychology focused too much on factors that were optimized for scoring individuals, not describing the constructs. Interstitial space was ignored. Simple structure was confused for hierarchy. Data was largely from small samples of WEIRD undergrads. It wasn’t appreciated that the Big Five are simply varimax rotated word vectors.

Now we have terabytes of natural language data from all over the world. We have the compute, models, and method to translate that to personality structure [link to me and david]. We have open science, and we have a more diverse set of voices. The time is ripe for another round of the long debate. Keep reading the blog for front row seats. (And share to get me to keep writing these, plenty more are half done.)

# Epistemic statusOne thing the rationalists get right is to [rate claims by epistemic status](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Hrm59GdN2yDPWbtrd/feature-idea-epistemic-status). This is better than the norm in academia: to make mostly safe claims to get by reviewers. Progress goes faster when we articulate ideas that *may* be true.### Equivalence of ‘general’ factorsEven without introducing new data, I’m actually quite confident that GFP is roughly equivalent to p and g-PD. There are many range restriction problems, the best way to solve them would be to literally take questions from p and g-PD and include them in the measure of general personality.

range restriction problems are real though. We spend more time justifying speaking too loud or hitting someone (totally innocuous if it’s an accident) than why we killed our father. Hence FFP loading more on being rude than patricidal. This is influenced by what words count as general. Using 2918 words, most of the top 30 have to do with politeness. Using Allport’s 18k words, the first factor instead loads on extreme bad behavior. Screeching, megalomaniacle, etc. Those word lists are in the footnotes here[^4] and here. It’s okay to try and make theoretical contributions like this before we have settled on the ‘best’ lexical model. 

I also want to note that different choices about what NLP data to consider produces different FFP. Above I embed a small list of 100 basic personality adjectives translated into 7 languages using a multilingual language model (XLM-RoBERTa). 

### FFP is not generaldepends on the definition of general. If general means that it captures something related to all parts of personality, then I don’t think so. FFP ex uncorrelated with extraversion or time preference. 

### FFP is hierarchically related to general personalityHere general personality means a multiple factor model that can describe normal variation. Medium. Problem is multiple definitions of hierarchically. I think that words, and people, exist first on FFP, then can distinguish themselves at finer levels.

### Beta is not hierarchically related to the Big Fivehigh. Beta or PC2 is largely unaffected by varimax rotation, at least with 5 factors. Like all but the first factor, it is normally distributed.

### FFP cuts nature at its jointsHigh. The nature of language is explanatory, we tell stories when we describe. Further, language records the direction social pressure. This was important in our evolution towards humanity. Finally, GFP is used when personality psychologists look for causal mechanisms.

# ConclusionSoft case was initially made for the Big Five in “close no doors”.

> “The danger with Pervin's critique [of the Big Five] is that it might prove divisive and close some doors, rather than emphasize our common goals”

Ironically, with the adoption of Big Five, lexical analysis was largely abandoned. Why did researchers who had item and word data, who knew the nature of the Big Two could only be resolved using that, instead use derivative *aspects*? As an outsider, my guess is that once the Big Five was adopted, none of the big players wanted to return to the debate of general personality structure. The field had successfully exported the model, why rock the boat? This makes sense if one believes that only a descriptive framework is possible. Enter incremental science where it is delusional to believe a model can slice nature at it’s joints.In this post I started by doing what Ashton suggested with Alpha and Beta: go back to the item-level data. Found that alpha is simply the first principal component of lexical data, which can be reproduced with high fidelity using NLP. This answers the two persistent questions about the GFP. Is it an artifact? No. How is it related to the Big Five? It is the first unrotated factor of the data on which the Big Five were based. 

General, indeed oversells this factor. At least 3 factors are required to build a *general* model of personality. Primary is a more appropriate name. It is of chief importance; we can’t help but process social desirability even when asked about other traits. This has implications for how we measure personality. The invention of language changed the fitness landscape. Since Darwin, our appreciation of cultural evolution has increased. Heinrich and preserving knowledge, moralizing gods. Writing is new. We evolved along PFP more than g. 

I believe social pressures made an inner voice fit. There are various words for our inner monologue that answers to society. Inner monologue, conscience, still small voice. It is usually about correcting our impulses to conform to social mores. Coming from the other direction, Elephant in Brain emphasizes its role in rationalizing personal desires to the group. Psychology may have the worst conceptualization with social self-monitoring, extraversion by another name.

Psychology is hobbled by its instruments. Understanding the genesis of the Big Five allows us to answer how PFP relates to the Big Five, as well as whether it is an artifact. Mired for decades debating these basic facts, researchers could not ask the more interesting questions raised in the second half of this blog. When they were, as with the connection between social self-monitoring and general personality, poor instruments once again shrouded the connection. 

There is a tradeoff between probing constructs, and measuring people on those constructs. Many choices about how to represent constructs are made in order to build an instrument. These are not essential to the construct, however in the quantitative regime, once an instrument is designed, this is primary way to ask questions about the construct. How can you measure a construct without scoring a bunch of people?

Language is a way out, as I have argued in In the Beginning Was the Word. We can locate specific constructs in personality space by the location of the word vectors. No subjects are needed. In the case of PFP, the construct is simply the first PC. Because we know the function of language, this offered theoretical insight about what it is. [We expect pfp to be social self-regulation because language is gossip ++. Qualitatively, that is a very good description of the word loadings.] This explains some of the curious aspects of GFP in surveys. It’s general, in the sense that it always appears. Humans, a social species, cannot help but evaluate and respond to social approval. This is not just response bias, as some claim. The PFP is the vector of social pressure along which we evolved. 

## What to do about joints?Good chefs know the importance of maintaining sharp knives in the kitchen. What’s their secret? A well-worn Taoist allegory offers some advice. The king asks about his butcher ’ s impressive knife-work. “Ordinary butchers,” he replies “hack their way through the animal. Thus their knife always needs sharpening. My father taught me the Taoist way. I merely lay the knife by the natural openings and let it find its own way through. Thus it never needs sharpening.” Plato famously employed this “ carving” metaphor as an analogy for the reality of Forms: like an animal, the world comes to us predivided. Ideally, our best theories will be those which “carve nature at its joints.” Slater and Broghini, [Carving nature at it’s joint](https://philarchive.org/archive/SLAILF#:~:text=Plato%20famously%20employed%20this%20%E2%80%9C%20carving,carve%20nature%20at%20its%20joints.%20%E2%80%9D)s[As a footnote: Nature at joints means there are natural kinds. Personality researchers don’t believe in types so I assume the authors meant something softer. I do think that personality has causes, and PFP lines up with both natural selection and personal social development. There is no important cause so nearly captured by a Big Five factor.] 

This post seeks to explain a great deal. To the extent that it succeeds, it is because nature has joints and lexical analysis finds them. The quote disparaging such models argues that the number of factors and their rotation doesn’t really matter. Models have different purposes, and we can’t hope to find a general one much better than the Big Five (or Three or HEXACO). We have been debating this for a century, the thinking goes, there are still rocks unturned? **If the claims in this post hold up, yes. Which means** **reducing lexical data is back on the table and general structure is up for debate.**The PFP is the most important factor of human nature. It’s not a statistical artifact. It plays a dominant role in our individual development, as well as that of our species. The Big Five obscures this by shuffling PFP variance onto factors an order of magnitude less important.

Many thanks to alex, derin, jonathan, who helped with BLAH BLAH. I am currently looking for a personality researcher who is fluent in non-European languages. Let me know if you’d like to collaborate. Always looking for feedback and different perspectives; leave a comment. Please share to any of your friends taken in by Big Big Five. There’s still hope for them!

[^1]: For example “An alternative solution, using the procedure of Schmid and Leiman (1957) is to calculate the g loadings from the hierarchical solution, extract the general factor, and the find the residual loadings on the remaining orthogonal factors (Fig. 1). The amount of general factor saturation, McDonald’s coefficient xh (McDonald, 1999; Revelle & Zinbarg, 2009; Zinbarg et al., 2005), is found by squaring the sum of the general factor loadings and dividing by the sum of the total correlation matrix. The resulting value, .35, is the percentage of variance accounted for by the general factor.” Revelle and Wilt, The general factor of personality: A general critiqueThis paper includes good analysis on the generalness of GFP, including suggesting the name FFP. However, it indicates how overwrought some of the methods are, considering that one could simply go back to word- or item-level data to get a much clearer picture.

[^2]: Instead of going back to the item (BFI) or word (original lexical data) level, the authors derivative Aspects as lower-level personality variables. Aspects are defined by treating each factor scale as an independent survey and doing factor analysis. Two factors are extracted and rotated.This choice is curious considering the authors had access to both word and item level data, and Aspects do not fulfil their own criterion of being lower-level “personality variables that define the personality factors”. Aspects are the reverse; defined by the personality factors.

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*[anti-GFP paper (Ashton and Goldberg) uses aspects that are derived by looking at items related to a single factor and doing factor analysis. The fact that factor scales, designed to measure a single construct, are multifactored should be a red flag. Highlight the difficulty asking pure questions to social creatures. This is speculative, but given how hard it is to ask a question not related to social desirability, one could imagine it being represented in the first two PCs of questions on each of the factors. These are then rotated, then treated as lower-level aspects of the Big Five.]

[At any rate, the data marshaled is even more derivative than the BFI factors. Remember, this paper starts by claiming the question of hierarchy “can only be tested with data on lower level personality variables that define the personality factors”. And on that front it surely fails. To understand the structure we have to go back to the actual data used to define the factors: language.]

The inverse is causing harm to people (including oneself) seemingly for the sake of it. This is similar to the multilingual data, but emphasizes conformity. Closer to go-along-to-get-along than social intelligence. One interpretation could be that English speakers emphasize decorum to a greater degree. I think most of the difference is explained by having 2819 words instead of 80. In the multilingual data the top words are friendly and easygoing. The larger set simply has ~50 variations on that theme before getting to words with more of an edge. Still, moreresearchisneeded to understand the NLP data.
