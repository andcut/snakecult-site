Anthropology conference cancelled talk about sex. Best thought of as a fight between camps, but the blank slate camp has institutational power. Reminiscent of the paper Where did Anthropology Go, which argues the whole discipline has painted itself into a relatavistic corner. 

If Economics is the dismal science, then Anthropology should have become the gay science described by Nietszche, a form of intellectual inquiry that joyfully grapples with life's complexities, uncertainties, and paradoxes. Instead, it chose to become the masturbatory science, unwilling to engage with the world as it is. Worse still, the field has developed an antibody response to those that seek to understand basic human nature.

Much of this post draws on arguments laid out in *Where did anthropology go?: or the need for 'human nature,'* by anthropologist Maurice Bloch. He notes that the field has painted itself into a corner by rejected its original charter: the study of our species from when it emerged up until the invention of writing (at which point history proper takes over). Why should the field exist, if that is no longer seen as a worthy goal?That was written in 2005. Two decades later, the situation is much worse. At the 2023 conference for the American Anthropological Association there was going to be panel titled *Let’s Talk about Sex Baby: Why biological sex remains a necessary analytic category in anthropology*. This, it turns out, is beyond the pale in Anthropology, and organizers shut down the discussion, issuing a statement *[No Place For Transphobia in Anthropology: Session pulled from Annual Meeting program](https://americananthro.org/news/no-place-for-transphobia-in-anthropology-session-pulled-from-annual-meeting-program/).*“The session was rejected because it relied on assumptions that run contrary to the settled science in our discipline, framed in ways that do harm to vulnerable members of our community.”

Ironically, one of the motivating questions in anthropology was the role of women in the formation of culture, and therefore, the species. Primitive hoard w/o paternity → women banding together. 

[One of the first questions in anthropology was if there was a primordial matriarchy. Hundreds of years by patriarchalists, matriarchalists, commies, fascists, psychoanalysts and new agers. Even as recently as 90s, this was proposed by Dunbar and Knight. Still discussed. So there is a minority (or maybe silent majority?) that thinks sex is relevant. But institutionally off the table. Not going to get grants on the idea that women discovered the human condition.]

One might ask what sort of explorations into sex and gender could receive grants. Well, it turns out, one can go pretty far, as long as the politics are right. There is a real anthropology dissertation that consists of masturbating to Japanese cartoon images of boys, which is supposedly informative to alienation and growing up. This is NOT the gay science that Nietzsche imagined.

[mention where I am coming from this. I’m not a great essayist, nor have I wrapped my mind around science or the history of science. But I have tried to understand who we are and where we came from. And it’s incredible how consistently that is obfuscated for the same reasons. So I have something unique to say.]

# Where did Anthropology go?British polymath Herbert Spencer called anthropology "the natural history of society," echoing its goal in the Age of Enlightenment to understand the “universal history of mankind.” The name Anthropology reflects the scope of this ambition; from Greek *anthropos* (human) and *logia* (study). That is now regarded as folly.Begins with a story about a linguist, then the Malagasy. This is the most basic question, obvious to anyone. Anthropologists have taken billions of dollars to ostensibly study this, only to reject it as an acceptable question.

I ran into this as well. “that’s the question we need to problematize”

How did we get here?

OG guys

“The reason for the continuing influence of these writers and the relative lack of influence of their successors is not difficult to imagine. It is simply that these early authors gave answers, however unacceptable, to the questions asked by the Malagasy villagers and our colleagues in other disciplines, while more recent anthropologists do not.”

Evolution deemed as wrong

Pretty obvious reasons. Can see it in response to Witzel’s work.

Maurice mentions that this is not fair at all. They were often very progressive.

Diffusion deemed as wrong

graham hancock statement calls him racist

All that’s left is moral relativism. Which is unfortunately enforced! See the transgender thing. But also the bullroarer thing.

Auto-erotic dissertations get a free pass. Almost nothing more perfectly nihilistic. Does not threaten the regime!

# The Heilephant in the RoomHe gets through the whole essay with using the n word, but I think it’s worth talking about Nazis.

Waddel, neo-nazi, and regular right-winger

# The long arm of the blank slateThe response is “yes there are excesses but those are not part of anthro writ large, which still engages with what it means to be human”

*[Image: Visual content from original post]*

IMO it’s not just social anthro, but most of academia. Dan Everette no longer allowed to visit the Piraha.

# ConclusionAnthropologists may have given up the identity quest, but other fields are carrying that torch. Stone Age Herbalist, an anon archeologist: “Long-time readers might have a sense of déjà vu here, another 19th century theory brought back to life after a century of refutation, thanks to modern genetics. We’ve seen this with the invasions from the steppe, the Bell Beakers, the Anglo-Saxons, the Swahili-Persians, the introduction of agriculture into Europe and many more places.”

Moreover, in places like this blog, I can ask who we are and where we came from. It may turn out that the human condition is recent and discovered by women. Such ideas could not be pursued in the academy, which chooses to live in an alternate reality where sex does not exist, and it is wrong to try to understand human origins.

“The discipline was thus to operate a bridge between the history of life up to the emergence of Homo sapiens, the subject matter of Zoology, and the history of mankind from the time of the invention of writing, by which point historians could take over. Evidence to account for what had happened during this gap was to come from the four fields approach, still evident in many anthropology departments in the United States. The four fields were archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistics and what became social and cultural anthropology.”

“Very shortly after its establishment, evolutionist anthropology was destroyed by an obvious but fundamental criticism. This criticism took very different forms but it is always ultimately based on the same objection and is usually called the theory of diffusionism.”

“The reason for the continuing influence of these writers and the relative lack of influence of their successors is not difficult to imagine. It is simply that these early authors gave answers, however unacceptable, to the questions asked by the Malagasy villagers and our colleagues in other disciplines, while more recent anthropologists do not.””Of course denying the unity of mankind is not new in anthropology but those who previously advocated such a position, the so called polygenists of the nineteenth century, argued that mankind was made up of four unrelated species and who consequently approved of slavery and the hunting of Australian Aborigines as though they were wild animals. These might not be the precursors the present day relativists would wish to claim.””This is what produces the situation I described at the outset of this lecture, where anthropologists instead of attempting to respond to the kind of request of our psycho linguist go into what looks like a silent sulk wrapped in an aura of self righteousness.”Much of this was used in the more politic bullroarer piece. But I’d still like to answer

what scared them off the grand identity quest

what they have become

That structure might look like:

Conclusion

This is why theories like EToC are not more common. The Big Questions aren’t on the table in the field that was designed to ask them.

Introduce anthropology by Age of Enlightenment definition

Diffusion one of the answers. You can see how it offends modern sensibilities: https://alor.org/Storage/Library/PDF/Waddell_LA-The_British_Edda.pdf

[picture that Waddel interprets as the evil serpent priestesses torturing men] EToC a bit like the mirror of his beliefs. Feminist, but still relies on diffusion.

Even if diffusion was true, anthropologists wouldn’t want to know. This isn’t just about Nazis. It’s also feminism, post-modernism, bureaucratization and distrust of grand theories, focus on differences.

But this puts us in a bind because diffusion may be part of our identity quest. To answer the big questions we have to face our fears. There may be such a thing as truth and progress, men and women may be different, and the bible might be kind of right about how humans came to be.

Anthropology is the [most liberal occupation in the country](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/03/why-your-flight-attendant-is-probably-a-democrat/). Narrowing the playing field to academia, anthropologists are the most likely to say they would not hire an Evangelical ([60%](https://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-disappearing-conservative-professor)). In a [recent survey](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335591318_Anthropology's_Science_Wars_Insights_from_a_New_Survey), 54% said antiscientific attitudes undermine their field. The same survey can give a flavor of these attitudes. Only 31% agreed that men have evolved a desire for more sexual variety. 76% agreed the social construct of “race” has no corresponding biological reality. (One must wonder what oracle 23 and Me consults if there is no map from DNA to race.) Moreover, only 39% believe that advocacy and fieldwork should be kept separate for objectivity.British polymath Herbert Spencer called anthropology "the natural history of society," echoing its goal in the Age of Enlightenment to understand the “universal history of mankind.” This is the basic identity quest: to know who we are, where we came from, and when. Whether anthropologists have abandoned this mission or simply expanded it to include other goals (e.g., postmodernism, psychoanalysis, decolonization) lies in the eye of the beholder. I argue they problematized the question into oblivion, to the detriment of the public who pays for their grants.

# Abdicating the identity questIn a previous post, I wrote about the evidence for global cultural cultural diffusion. Statistically speaking, the Seven Sisters myth is the most compelling item because it is present on all continents and nigh-impossible to explain without diffusion. However, the most culturally interesting evidence of diffusion is the bull-roarer, used in male initiation ceremonies worldwide. As the name suggests, Homo Sapiens is defined by ideas. But, as a rule, these do not fossilize. The bull-roarer is crucial for an archeology of mind because it is central to cultures in so many places and is an instrument that has been preserved for as long as 40,000 years. If all these practices share a common root, then it implies there was a primordial substratum of human culture that spread the world over. On the other hand, if the bull-roarer is invented time and time again to be used in the same ways, it implies that our species is incredibly similar—almost deterministically so—on an abstract ritual level.

Diffusionism was a popular school of thought within Anthropology in the first half of the 20th century. Among other things, it held that culture tended to be invented once and diffuse. So, all primitive cultures would share a root deep in the past, and high civilization would have a more recent root going back to Egypt or Sumer. The story of anthropology in the last century is “Let’s stop right there at ‘primitive,’ we have some problematizing to do.” Many good points have been made about decolonizing the field, but I’m still interested in how to explain the bull-roarer.

Diffusion has been successfully dismantled within the academy, and yet every couple of decades, a researcher will find the bull-roarer anew and say, “Gosh, it *really* looks like diffusion.” Take, for example, Bethe Hagen in 2009:*The bullroarer and buzzer were once well-known and well-loved by anthropologists. They functioned within the profession as hallmark artifacts that symbolized the cultural relativist commitment to independent invention even as evidence (size, shape, meaning, uses, symbols, ritual) stretching tens of thousands of years across human history pointed to diffusion. In virtually every part of the world, even today, these artifacts continue to be invented (?) and re-symbolized in many of the ancient ways.*Note that Hagen is not a diffusionist. Still, she has spent decades studying the bull-roarer and says point blank that the size, shape, meaning, uses, symbols, and rituals are markedly similar in virtually every part of the world and that diffusion is a natural explanation. Or, consider another non-diffusionist, Thomas Gregor, who says the same in 1973:

**Interest has long since waned in "diffusionist” anthropology, but recent evidence is very much in accord with its predictions.** Today we know that the bullroarer is a very ancient object, specimens from France (13,000 B.C.) and the Ukraine (17,000 B.C.) dating back well into the Paleolithic period. Moreover, some archeologists—notably, Gordon Willey (1971)—now admit the bullroarer to the kit-bag of artifacts brought by the very earliest migrants to the Americas. **Nevertheless, modern anthropology has all but ignored the broad historical implication of the wide distribution and ancient lineage of the bullroarer.**Other than Hagen’s work in 2009, the last systematic treatment of the bull-roarer was by a Freudian anthropologist in 1973, which introduces itself: *“The present psychoanalytic essay draws attention to the possible anal components of male initiation arguing that the bullroarer is a flatulent phallus.”* The [paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2800206) is actually an excellent overview of the research up to that point; the author is a knowledgeable scholar. However, his ideology reduces the bull-roarer to a farting penis of initiation when it may be a key piece of evidence of who we are and where we came from. Compare the Jungian analysis to that of the diffusionists back in 1920, who deigned to engage with the material question of how the bull-roarer is so widespread:

*“Why do Brazilians and Central Australians deem it death for a woman to see the bull-roarer? Why this punctilious insistence on keeping her in the dark on the subject in West and East Africa and Oceania? I know of no psychological principle that would urge the Ekoi and the Bororo mind to bar women from knowledge about bull-roarers and until such a principle is brought to light I do not hesitate to accept diffusion from a common center as the more probably assumption. This would involve historical connection between the rituals of initiation into the male tribal societies of Australia, New Guinea, Melanesia, and Africa.” ~*[Primitive Society, p313](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.275524/page/n323/mode/2up) (1920)The remarkable similarities need explaining. Narrowly, my argument isn’t necessarily that the diffusionists were right. There is room for debate. However, all parties recognize that studying the bull-roarer can reduce uncertainty about the role of diffusion. In the last 50 years, anthropologists have been profoundly uninterested in knowing the answer.

# The Eve Theory of Consciousness (EToC) and bull-roarersMy interest in bull-roarers is not merely academic. I have [a theory](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/eve-theory-of-consciousness-v2) that we became human when we became aware of ourselves as moral agents. Our unique human abilities—preoccupation with the past and future, grammatical language, recursion, understanding our mortality, and dualistic thinking—are [all predicated on self-awareness](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/deja-you-the-recursive-construction). Since women have better theory of mind and are more prone to internalizing behavior, they likely would have looked inward and discovered this package first. Later, rituals were developed to share it with men.That these abilities could be shared is important, for it means they could spread even without genetic contact. There’s not a “recursion gene;” there are thousands. It’s only by becoming self-aware that populations started driving that set of genes to higher levels.

This theory draws from creation myths and finds support in genetics and linguistics. **One prediction of the theory is that male initiation rituals worldwide will share a common root more recent than the Out of Africa migration.** Hence, the EToC may hinge on the bull-roarer question. When were they first used, and did they spread?The theory also predicts the diffusion of creation myths and a primordial (ritual) matriarchy. Surprisingly, these themes are some of the [most substantial evidence for global diffusion](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/evidence-for-global-cultural-diffusion) and are intricately connected to bull-roarers. Hagen, the lone bull-roarer researcher, studies them precisely because [they are associated with consciousness worldwide](https://www.vortexmaps.com/bethe-hagens/bethe-hagens-spin-creative-consciousness.php).I have devoted time to EToC because it is a well-behaved scientific theory, which is rare for models of consciousness, human origins, or Genesis. It makes strong predictions about pronouns, the Y chromosome, serpent myths, and male initiation rituals. These should be falsifiable, though that may mean asking questions anthropology has abandoned.

# Problematizing questionsProctor punting

Corballis says it’s all recursion.

200k really not very compelling. Instead of any of the abilities he discusses, has to refer to a technological complex [mostly associated with Neanderthals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levallois_technique).Also, where’s the signals of evolution? [plot of recent evolution]

He then says “well maybe it was 40kya.” Very similar to Chomsky, who only barely misses the mark b/c he says it has to be in Africa. 

Witzel does exactly the same.

posits that stories go back 65-130k years. Around 20kya a more philosophical Eurasian version emerged and spread, expanding on the original themes. Notes language only exists for 40k, and there has been lots of evolution since then. And also that there is no evidence for religion before 40kya. Response is just “but how could Africa and Australia be so similar?”

Could have been answered if anthropologists had studied the bull-roarer.

give example of Australia dog, rainbow serpent, pronouns, technology, and male initiation rituals that use the bull-roarer/circumcision all diffuse. The creation myth is it was taught to them at the beginning of time by Mimi or the rainbow spirit. You can see why anthropologists would prefer these to go back 50-100k rather than 7k.

My diffusion article explains the data. If you need to explain why some places are less philosophical, just consider lossy transmission far from the source. Some details were lost.

still called a Nazi

Doesn’t even have to be this nefarious. 

Diffusionists may say A and B are connected. An anti-diffusionist says: okay, what path did they take, the onus is on you to show it. or “oh, so you think that X group wasn’t smart enough to come up with that on their own?”

Rainbow serpent in Australia. Diffusion 6kya breaks a lot of meaning-making beliefs. Diffusion 65kya doesn’t.

fads just happen; plenty of unanswered questions. these ones just don’t get play anymore.

This isn’t everyone. They cite a bunch of people. Classic Upper Paleolithic model. Antonio. But nobody has articulated the phenomenological change that occurred, connected it via gene-culture interaction to ritual, and argued for diffusion, as well as preservation in myths. Because of my background, I also connect it to personality theory as a freebie.

The reason more people have not tried is because the project has been problemetized to such a degree. 

https://www.vectorsofmind.com/i/114632067/years-ago-sodomy-in-the-uncanny-valley

The desire to not ask difficult questions is made more clear by an interview with Lex Fridman. Robert Proctor is a historian of science specializing in how forces like the tobacco industry or WWII shape the interpretation of data. He also studies human origins at Stanford. When asked [directly when we evolved](https://youtu.be/Y3VBCWIDEzk?t=7129) Proctor punts: *That is exactly the question we need to problematize. It’s what I call the Ghandi question. When asked “what do you think of western civilization?” he said “it would be a good idea”. So, when did humans evolve? Well not yet… What’s happened in the last 50 or 60 years—which I think is a good thing, intellectually—is that we’ve smeared out humanness to mean many different things. It’s not just tool use or upright posture…It’s an interesting question because after WWII as a result of Nazism no one wanted to be the one to say that this particular fossil we’ve just found was anything less than fully human so there’s a projection of humanness arbitrarily back into the past so that even these little monkey-like creatures rhombopithicus were being declared to have folkways and mores and language which is ridiculous. No one wanted to be the one to say that Neanderthals were anything less than fully human. It’s a very interesting question; human origins is very much an identity quest. When we became us sort of begs the question, "What are we?”*I don’t know about Proctor’s politics particularly. But it is poetic that many anthropologists are literal communists sucking at government teat. Almost as a caricature, if you ask them the most basic question they are charged to study—“when did we become us?”—you may get a “that’s problematic; we have agreed to say it was a long—indeterminable—time ago.”

But there is a promising candidate for a line in the sand: recursion. I have discussed elsewhere that many philosophers and linguists believe this is what makes us human, and have argued that it allows for language, thinking about the future, counting, and abstract thought. In fact, later in the conversation, Proctor discusses how the humans who made cave art were definitely like us because they could conceive and share imaginary worlds. This glosses over the natural interpretation of cave art, that it represents humans becoming like us, and that recursion was not yet fully integrated. Ironic, given this is precisely the point he makes to dodge the question. Becoming human was a process that may not be complete.

Very common to say myths go back to Africa. Origins of mythology. Witzel is tenured at Harvard. But imagine being on the anthropology job market with a review of your book: “Let me make clear that I do not take Witzel himself to be racist. Rather, I believe he has written a seriously flawed book whose conclusions carry racist implications.”

“co-founded the Program in Comparative Studies in Discourse and Society”

“It is generally assumed that the earliest evidence for the religious ideas of current humans involves the representations found in Stone Age rock and cave art as well as some sculptures of human or humanlike figures such as the “Great Mother” and the lion-human.28 In addition, there are some indications of early forms of shamanism in cave paintings such as those at Lascaux, which may be compared with the many comparable representations of shamans and “witch doctors” in recent and modern populations, from South Africa to Australia and from Siberia into the Americas.”

He then goes on to discuss when fully recursive language evolved, noting that many say 40-50kya. 

He rejects this with 

“It is neither economical nor elegant, but factually impossible, to attribute the similarities among Australian, Andamanese, and San shamanism to some late diffusion—when, and from where?—or to some sort of independent local development based on Jungian “shared human characteristics””

“These groups cannot have independently developed, in their new homelands, the closely related, overlapping, and even identical forms of Gondwana and Laurasian mythology (§§ 5–6). It simply cannot have occurred independently at a time when, according to Wunn, humans were just about to begin to develop their new faculty of creating complex religion and mythology—that is, during the Upper Paleolithic, more than 20,000 years after the exodus.”

He then 

Corballis and his 200k [picture of new mutations]. To his credit also presents 40k as an option, but it is not very seriously considered.

Chomsky and his magic single mutation

It’s not that nobody is studying this. Antonio, behavioral modernity in retrospect and the Great Coincidence (I don’t know anyone who said, hey, that was recursion!)

EToC not the only gig in town. What I’m trying to say is there is a widely held ideological commitment not to let human origins be recent or traceable to modern cultural phenomenon. This is in stark contrast to the comparative mythologists who claim many cultural phenomena (including the snake who tempts eve) go back 100,000 years. 

[Over and over global culture is said to go back 100k years. What’s all the change 40-10kya about then? Myths should be informative! The people who study say they are glad we don’t really know how we became human, and that they try to push the date farther back for political reasons.]

# ConclusionIn some ways, this post is trying to answer why an engineer could propose a true account of human origins. If women were self-aware first and that was faithfully recorded in the Bible, there would be hints in many disciplines ([including AI](https://www.vectorsofmind.com/p/the-ai-basis-of-the-eve-theory-of)). Why didn’t others find it first? Well, like any good theory, most of the constituent parts had already been proposed. That nobody put it together just so is not surprising, given the ideological commitments of most of those who receive grants to study the subject. Accepting gender differences alone would be a bridge too far for many academics. In some ways EToC should be a good fit in feminist [and indigenous] anthropology. However, in practice the movement is greatly concerned with “biological essentialism” and would be hung up by phrases like “women tend to internalize more”—an essential claim of EToC. Further, it has allies in other deconstructionist schools that are hostile to the concept of progress, especially if it purports to come from Eurasia and have spread. Finally, if most anthropologists would not hire an Evangelical, would they put forth a theory that the Bible is kind of right about creation?I have enough readers; I’m not yelling into the void. Some anthropologists or related experts will read this. I don’t mean to demonize, and assume that many are sympathetic with some of my arguments here. I have enjoyed what I have read in this space. However, I have a few questions that remain.

When did we first become aware of ourselves as moral agents who would one day die? Is that enough to produce recursive thinking?

Are there global myths that share a common root? If so, when and where is that root? Close to the first evidence of self-awareness? If global myths predate this moment, would the story of discovering the human condition tend to be preserved with greater fidelity than the Seven Sisters?

Why is the bull-roarer so often used in male initiation rituals? I (and others) have proposed it was part of an early cultural package first evidenced 20-40kya in Eurasia. Some parts of that package (e.g., dogs) did diffuse; why not the whole thing?

I realize these questions appear on a blog without the trappings of any authority. But they are sincere! I want to know who we are and where we came from. To do so, I have cobbled together the Eve Theory of Consciousness, which strikes me as the most beautiful possible scenario for how we became human. More than just an answer to the when and how of sapience, it connects us to thousands of years of debate about what to do about it. All cultures with a creation story can have their say.

The identity quest has been problematized in a dozen ways. But rarely is the sin of omission litigated. If we can learn anything from cross-cultural anthropology, it is that everyone needs a cosmic origin story. One must know where they came from to understand where they can go[^1]. Life forces one to embark on the quest, however problematic.

As always, the most likely outcome for a grand theory is death. I hope that this post shows outsider status is not, by itself, a nail in the coffin.

Intro: Anthropology is politically biased

Most liberal occupation in America

Most biased against evangelicals in the academy

Only 15 even believe in the biology of race

That’s crazy! Is there some other understanding of the question? For me it’s an empirical question. Can you, with a grainy picture of the back of someone’s head, tell if their ancestors are from Africa? How about if you have their DNA? Assuming they simply saw “biology” and “race” and responded to that.

Same survey says they do not separate advocacy and science

Many in the field thinks anti-scientific attitudes harm the field

This piece will argue that the bias has caused Anthropology to cede the question of the natural history of man and given room for an engineer to propose EToC.

Anthropology has ceded the ground to be the “science of the natural history of man.”

Timeline of schools of thought

Diffusion easily explained by root 30kya. Completely ignored. It’s not a hard problem, there is the bullroarer:

“The bullroarer and buzzer were once well-known and well-loved by anthropologists. They functioned within the profession as ?hallmark artifacts? that symbolized the cultural relativist commitment to independent invention even as evidence (size, shape, meaning, uses, symbols, ritual) stretching tens of thousands of years across human history pointed to diffusion.” https://www.vortexmaps.com/bethe-hagens/bethe-hagens-spin-creative-consciousness.php 

Terrified that there may be a natural history, that we could have become human at a given time and place. (lex fridman interview)

Relation to EToC

Scott Alexander linked me as an anthropologist. I do have to answer why an outsider would have anything to add. EToC is exactly the type of thing that anthropologists would not pursue even if it were true; we have very good evidence of this fact!

diffusionists: “there is a shared primitive substrata across the globe.” Anthropologists then spent a century deconstructing the word “primitive.” Material evidence was ignored. Moreover, the “natural history” question was assumed to be impossible. Humans have no beginning; at least one we can study. (see my piece in the evolution of recursion)

Small space carved out for Out of Africa, but even then:

Review of Origins of Mythology goes hard that it is Nazi science.

This extends to linguistics, the other field concerned with human origins: Chomsky, Corballis, Mother-tongue linguists (many literal communists, and the “primitive substrate” was made to fit their ideology. It was the common language of the Proletariat)

So, if diffusion is real, it may have to be introduced by an engineer, unaware of the strictures of Anthropology. I just asked “when did we identify with our inner voice?” Thought that Genesis was a shockingly good explanation, and particularly that the female-first aspect needed explaining. The rest has been me stumbling on supporting evidence. Pronouns, diffusion of snake cult, etc. There would be an enormous diffusion gradient for recursion/sapience.

I have answered objections to diffusionism

The path the memes traveled (whatever path dogs took)

Why the memes traveled

These ideas are dangerous. Yes, but hard to imagine a Semitic-Basque-Sino-Dennean Mother Goddess coalition as appreciably fascist. Never seen it in the comments section

Conclusion

Anthropologists have given up on the natural history of sapience. But they don’t have a monopoly. The thing I love about EToC is that it connects traditions spanning millennia. We are aware of our agency and mortality, what do we do about that? This is _the_ question, and we can’t let anthropologists decide it is off limits. There is no way to opt out of the identity quest.

EToC is similar to E.B. Tylor’s theory of primitive animism. That the first spiritual state was that man realized that within him dwells a kind of phantom or ghost capable of leaving the body during sleep, trance, and sickness, and finally going away altogether at death. By extending this doctrine to nature, the difference between a living or dead thing was the presence or absence of a “soul.”

[Save for a later and even more polemic piece.] There’s a scene in Dark Knight where The Joker asks the criminals if their balls dropped off. Apropos for anthropology. They’ve sequestered themselves in their ivory tower, chaffing after decades of self-referential mental masturbation. 

**Evolutionism (Late 19th Century):** Proposes that societies progress through fixed stages from savagery to civilization, aiming to uncover universal laws of cultural development.**Historical Particularism (Early 20th Century):** Focuses on the unique historical context of each culture; emphasizes ethnographic fieldwork, moral relativism, and the rejection of universal laws, favoring an individualized understanding of cultures.**Diffusionism (Early to Mid 20th Century):** Investigates how cultural traits and innovations spread from one society to another; explores patterns of cultural borrowing and interconnectedness.**Functionalism (Mid 20th Century):** Analyzes how specific cultural practices and institutions function to meet individual and societal needs; emphasizes the interrelatedness of various aspects of culture.**Structuralism (Mid 20th Century):** Investigates the universal mental structures underlying cultural phenomena; explores deep, unconscious structures that govern human thought and behavior.**Cultural Materialism (Late 20th Century):** Emphasizes the role of material conditions, technology, and economic factors in shaping culture; examines how these tangible aspects influence cultural beliefs and practices.**Postmodernism (Late 20th to Early 21st Century):** Characterized by skepticism toward grand narratives and objective truth; stresses the importance of subjectivity, power relations, and the constructed nature of knowledge.**Feminist Anthropology (Late 20th to Early 21st Century):** Focuses on gender roles, power dynamics, and the experiences of women within cultural contexts; examines how gender shapes and is shaped by culture.**Medical Anthropology (Late 20th to Early 21st Century):** Centers on health and illness within diverse cultural contexts; examines how cultural, social, and biological factors interact to influence health practices, perceptions, and outcomes.
