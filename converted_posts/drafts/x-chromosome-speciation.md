[Note: current position is that this is not a home run. In non-Africans, about 10% of the X chromosome is protected from Archaic introgression. However, there is also positive selection on these regions, meaning that just 1 of all of the haplogroups made it out of Africa. Hard to imagine unless there’s just a few people in the out of Africa group. So the story is complicated. If it’s recursion, why was it selected out of Africa but not in? Could be that this is a response to other neanderthal genes (or new mutations). (The authors argue that it could be in response to a new y chromosome haplogroup that comes out of SE Asia around this time. Some sort of battle of the sex chromosomes.) But again, complicated story. What I can do is basically not commit to recursion before OoA. My contribution is linking evolution to myths, which makes the male story more important. Work on that, for now. X chromosome doesn’t kill the theory. Tends to support it. But no clean story yet.]

This is the penultimate post in a series on recursion. Previously, I reviewed how recursion is related to consciousness and various attempts to date when that evolved. The Eve Theory of Consciousness argued that there were glimmers of recursion 100-50k years ago, which was originally a female trait. This post explores the genetic predictions of that theory.

You may have noticed that men and women think differently. Don’t worry, it’s not a sin. In fact, [female preference for people vs things](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00189/full) is a well-studied phenomenon in psychology. If self-awareness was discovered, then the explorer of the interior would likely have been a woman. This is central to the _Eve_ Theory of Consciousness. 

Genetically, sex differences are coded on the X and Y chromosomes. Females are XX, and males are XY. So if consciousness was initially a female trait then some genes essential to recursion must be on the X chromosome. This would have predictable effects. Those essential genes would be “protected” whenever mutations entered the gene pool. Meaning those without the recursion genes would tend not to reproduce. Even if the reproductive disparity is just 1%, over thousands of years the signature will be pronounced.

In my evolutionary model soon after we evolved recursion _Homo Sapiens_ interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans. This suggests a nice test. Were there regions of the X chromosome that remained purely _Homo Sapiens_? And does the X chromosome have anything to do with recursion or theory of mind today?

A note about the scientific method: hypotheses can be falsified, not proven. Hence if you want to show a model is true, you use it to make predictions that can be shown to be false. You can’t _prove_ the model, but if it makes strong predictions that turn out to be true, it increases your confidence. The more surprising the prediction, the more your confidence increases. Hence the _theory_ of evolution isn’t a fact, per se, it’s just that [Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution). This post is an attempt to falsify the Eve Theory of Consciousness, not to prove it.

“The admixture with archaic humans that followed the main out-of-Africa event left a far smaller proportion of introgressed sequence in the X chromosome than in the autosomes. In non-African populations, the Neanderthal component is thus only 0.3% compared with 1.4% for the autosome. Denisovan admixture is virtually absent on the X chromosome, with only Oceanians carrying a small proportion (0.18%).”
