Translate the following English text to Mexican Spanish.

MANDATORY GUIDELINES:
1. Do **NOT** omit, shorten, summarise, reorder, or otherwise alter ANY content. The Spanish output must contain every sentence and element present in the original.
2. Preserve all Markdown formatting exactly (headers, links, lists, code blocks, etc.).
3. Maintain the scholarly tone and technical terminology.
4. Keep proper nouns, citations, references, HTML tags, and shortcodes unchanged.

Return only the fully translated text with no additional commentary."""

Translate the text below to accurate Mexican Spanish **without omitting, summarizing, or rearranging any content**.  Preserve *every* Markdown element (headers, links, lists, code, citations, shortcodes, HTML tags) exactly as in the original.

Additional formatting tweaks allowed ONLY when the source paragraph is longer than four sentences:
  • Break that long paragraph into two-to-three shorter paragraphs for mobile readability.
  • Optionally add limited inline emphasis (bold or italics) to highlight key terms; use this sparingly (a handful of times in the whole document).

Do not add new sub-headings, bullet lists, or summaries, and do not remove or change any information.  When in doubt, preserve the original structure.  Output only the translated Markdown text."""
